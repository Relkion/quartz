Though trying to find a good book in the sea of [Novel Updates](https://www.novelupdates.com/) is often like wading through a sea of trash, there are many shining gems in the genre if one would care to look.

Here are my personal recommendations if you're curious. Depending on their current licensing status, the chapters available online might be paywalled.

## Chinese
- [I Shall Seal the Heavens](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/) Old favorite, probably the one that got me hooked on C-Novels.
- [The Legendary Mechanic](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/the-legendary-mechanic/) Also has a pretty decent manhua adaptation that just began.
- [Crossing to the Future, it's Not Easy to Be a Man](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/crossing-to-the-future-its-not-easy-to-be-a-man/) Incomplete, and indefinitely on hiatus. Definitely proceed with caution, because if you get invested like me then realize this series might never get closure... dammit I might cry.
- [My Disciple Died Yet Again](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/my-disciple-died-yet-again/) This one is really fun and doesn't come with a billion chapters.
- [Quickly Wear the Face of the Devil](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/quickly-wear-the-face-of-the-devil/) widely regarded as the bible of BL Quick Transmigration.
- [Heroic Death System](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/heroic-death-system/) another BL with Quick Transmigration
- [Mo Dao Zhu Shi](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/the-founder-of-diabolism/) aka The Untamed on Netflix

## Japanese
-[Kumo Desu ga, Nani ka?](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/kumo-desu-ga-nani-ka/) They effed up the anime for this. Never speak of it.

## Korean
-[Legendary Moonlight Sculptor](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/the-legendary-moonlight-sculptor/) This one made me laugh so hard.

there's loads more, but I'll try to find time and update this list when I have more time.
