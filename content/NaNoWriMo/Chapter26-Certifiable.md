Dawn emerged, hesitant on this morning. A girl lay on the kang, doused in a sullen gray light through a mottled patchwork of rags and paper on the window frame. She had grown quiet hours ago, tears leaving not a trace on her face. Her eyes were blank, depths awash with unknown thoughts.

*Mortal?* Guang Qiu called out, uncertain. *You've not gone crazy, have you?*

The girl did not respond for a long time. Finally, her eyes twitched the slightest bit before landing on the ball. "Crazy? That's a mild term for how I'm feeling right now. I'm fucking certifiable."

*You... you seem rather lucid?*

"For now, you glorified pixie. Who knows when the next psychotic break is coming, JFC."

*You yourself said that Bai Xingyue is the best candidate for Bai Jing's replacement,* Guang Qiu said. *I put some thought into it and think you're right.*

"Oh my fucking god," Jiaojiao rubbed her eyes furiously. "Don't tell me this whole fiasco is because of what I told you? My god. Did I screw myself? Good bye Jiaojiao, hello darkness my old friend. *What the fuck. Guang Qiu, yobanaya suka.*" [^1]

*It's obvious, you lack... motivation.*

"You thought giving me schizophrenia would change that? Brilliant, excellent, you must be the star employee at Isekai Incorporated."

*I actually have a perfect track record! And far be it for a puny mortal to get in the way of that!* Guang Qiu hummed.

Jiaojiao was too worn out to argue. She'd spent the last five hours trying to put a lid of the geyser of negative emotions Bai Xingyue's memories had injected into her psyche. 

It was a strange sensation, to have another person's memories shoe-horned into your head. She could suddenly recall two separate lifetimes worth of memories, and the edges where they touched was also the fraying edges of her sanity, as if these two incompatible substances were scraping, rubbing, wearing away at each other.

Was she Jiaojiao with Bai Xingyue's memories or was she Bai Xingyue with Jiaojiao's memories?

Jiaojiao paused, hand once again going to her forehead. The insistent negative emotions, pound, pound, pounding away at her patience.

She had wondered what Bai Xingyue was like as a person, now she knew.

Bai Xingyue was... angry.

Very, very angry.

And she had every right to be.

*Mortal!*

"What?" Jiaojiao snapped.

*...I called you at least ten times, how dare you ignore me?*

"Are we still on speaking terms? After what you did to me?"

*Mortal! I've proven that I'm not without ways to discipline you! If you don't behave--*

"Or what? Will you make me even crazier? Yeet into another universe? Maybe this time the stone age? *Kooshay govno sooka!* [^2] *Jri govno i zdohni!* [^3]"

Guang Qiu buzzed in affront. *Don't think I don't know what you're saying, mortal! I'm well versed in languages! It's easy to see you're insulting me!*

Jiaojiao clapped sarcastically.

*Enough! Don't we have more important things to do? Take out the artifact!*

Jiaojiao paused, then patted her sleeves. fishing out the golden wood bracelet. She stared at it.

*Good good! Now cut your hand and place a drop of your blood--*

Jiaojiao flung it across the room.

*Mortal!*

"Get bent, you dumb fairy bitch."

*Are you insane?! That artifact is priceless!*

Jiaojiao really did feel a bout of insane laughter coming on.  She snickered into her fist.

*Go pick it up! What are you waiting for?*

Jiaojiao did not pick it up. She stood and flounced outside, a calm smile on her face. "Guang Qiu, you've been with me for a few days now. Surely you have some inkling of what kind of person I am?"

*Mortal!*

"Have I ever responded well to threats, insults or ultimatums?"

*Come back here!*

"Have I ever give you the idea that I'm interested in your little games of fate?"

*Mortal! Don't make me angry!*

"Guang Qiu, you're a real idiot," Jiaojiao gave the ball a wan smile. "You've just gone and trounced on my last nerve."

Jiaojiao ran into Hu Maoxun's courtyard, the concubine barely had the time to say hello before Jiaojiao was diving through the hole in the wall. Ten minutes later Jiaojiao was standing by the side of a busy road, watching the horse-drawn carts flying past, uncaring of the people whispering and pointing at her red-marked face. 

*What are you doing mortal? Why are you here making a spectacle of yourself.*

"I'm giving it a test."

*...giving what a test?* Guang Qiu asked, a thread of unease clearly making its way into it's voice. *What are you really doing here?*

"I'm going to see, how powerful destiny can be. For instance," Jiaojiao took a step off the side-path and into the main thorough-way. "What happens if the main character doesn't want to play anymore?"

With a last hop and step, Jiaojiao stepped directly into the path of a rushing carriage. The coachman yelled and drew back on the reins, but it was no use. The horses were far too fast. By the time they stopped, Jiaojiao would be a pancake with no more worries.

Jiaojiao gave the ball a manic smile. "Well? Do something. Aren't you very powerful?"

*Mortal! Look out!*

Jiaojiao was looking, every detail of the oncoming cart etched into her memory. The coachman's startled face, the flaring nostrils of the horses, annoyed at the sudden wrenching on their reigns. The first time she died, she hadn't felt any pain. It would be a lie to say she wasn't afraid, but the greater underlying emotion was elation. Elation and anger. 

A great monstrous anger.

Jiaojiao felt dizzy all of a sudden. A surge of fear overcame her. She frowned at held her head. *What's happening? Why am I behaving this way?*

*Death? I would never--*

The horses hooves were close enough to touch her robe. As if in slow motion, she saw the metal shoes glinting in the gloomy morning light. She saw the individual veins in the eyes of the horses, the wide open mouth of the panicked driver. She even thought she could count the drops of spittle flying from his mouth, shouting at her to *move.*

A warm body suddenly slammed into her. Time resumed its normal pace. The roll of the carts wheels passed inches from her face.

"You stupid beggar! Get out of the way!" the driver was yelling.

"Are you alright?" A fearful voice said, a hand pulling her up from the dusty road. "Why were you standing in the road?"

Jiaojiao looked up into Bai Xingyun's frowning face. Still reeling from the near-miss, she felt her pounding heart with a trembling hand. Adrenaline stealing the breath from her lungs.

"Are you hurt anywhere?" the boy was asking.

"What are you doing here?" Jiaojiao asked between pants, head between her knees.

"I... saw you crawl through the wall," Bai Xingyun said, a strange blush on his cheeks. "I was curious."

"You followed me?"

"Should... should I not have?" the boy asked. "I was worried about you."

"I don't even know you."

Jiaojiao knew for sure now that this boy had nothing to do with Bai Xingyue. After all, the girl's memories only had the vaguest impression of this shadow son of the Bai family. Before yestereday, he hadn't even spoken to "Bai Xingyue" So why was he so invested in her well-being?

What was he really after?

Jiaojiao distanced herself from the teenager, brows drawn in fatigue and confusion. She didn't even know herself right now, she wasn't in any condition to question the why and how of this boy's sudden interest in her.

"Stay away from me."

Jiaojiao wandered in a near fugue state, making her way back to the Bai estate. She vaguely sensed Bai Xingyun following her a few paces behind.

When she had crawled back through the hole in the wall, traveled past a puzzled Hu Maoxun to find her way back to her courtyard, Jiaojiao once again found herself sitting on the kang. For a moment she doubted she had ever left. Perhaps she had imagined the whole incident.

*Suicidal? Me?*

Jiaojiao knew herself well. If there had ever been a point in her life where she might have taken her own life it would have been--

Anyway. It wouldn't have been now. In this place. These feeling weren't hers. They weren't even Bai Xingyue's she didn't think. If anything, it was the conflict between their two warring personalities that was causing this... dysfunction.

"Guang Qiu, you've cocked it up," Jiaojiao groaned. "You've really gone and done it."

*Mortal?* Guang Qiu called, tentative, as if Jiaojiao were fragile to the point of bashing her brains out on the nearest pillar. *Are you feeling better?*

"What do you think, genius? I almost went and got myself trampled. God, what a way to go."

If she could rate the ways she wanted to die, her original way of death was perfect. No muss, no fuss, and her body was in perfect condition. Getting trampled to death by horses would rate at the other end of the spectrum, along with death by fire, or getting melted by acid.

It was *messy.*

And she hated mess.

"You're a *hooy morzhovy*." [^4]

"Who are you talking to?"

Jiaojiao froze for a good ten seconds, before her head turned creakily, as if on a rusted hinge, toward the source of the voice.

A young man wearing a porcelain demon mask sat at her battered tea table, inspecting the surroundings as if he were sightseeing. He lifted the lid on the days old pot of inferior tea, then closed the lid before pushing the pot aside like he'd unearthed a jar of feces.

"Hi," Jiaojiao said, a winning smile plastering itself on her face. "Long time no see!"

"I've been looking for you," the young man said.

"Really? Whatever for?" Jiaojiao's eyes began to dart about the room, searching for potential exit strategies. "I'm soooo sorry about that. You know, I was really busy that day, I couldn't just sit around *waiting*..."

"You, made me, look for you," the man said. "I don't like people who waste my time."

"Haha," Jiaojiao bit back an angry response barely in time. Must remember this boy was asura incarnate with a side of psycho. "So. Terribly. Sorry. Ahem, what did you want from me?"

"Not much" the boy unsheathed the sword at his waist, sending alarm bells blaring in Jiaojiao's mind. "Don't worry. It'll be over soon."

Jiaojiao couldn't resist rolling her eyes this time. "Look at this Guang Qiu, this is the Romeo you wanted to set me up with! It'll be over soon?"

"Are you mad?" Mo Wudi asked, voice only fluctuating slightly. "Who are you talking to?"

Jiaojiao laughed, high and hysterical. "Yeah, I'm pretty fucked up right now, but I gotta say, you're not much better, prick."

Mo Wudi paused. "Prick?"

"Pecker. Ding-dong. Bird. Holy shit, the last words out of my mouth are going to be slang for penis what is wrong with me."

"Are you done?" Mo Wudi said, an edge in his otherwise monotone voice.

"No. Hey, before you kill me, how about you hear me out, huh?"

"...what do you want to say?"

"I want to make a deal with you."
