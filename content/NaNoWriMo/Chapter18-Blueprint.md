"Jiaojiao!" Rui Si kicked Min Tong in the shin and darted over to hide behind Jiaojiao. 

"Immortal, are you doing, bullying a girl in the middle of the night?" Jiaojiao asked, patting Rui Si on the head, feeling her quake as the little girl clutched her robes.

"W--what? Don't speak nonsense!" Min Tong screeched, pushing past the two of them to enter the sleeping area.

Rui Si calmed as soon as Min Tong left. She looked up at Jiaojiao, eyes dark. "Big sis, did you hear what we were talking about?"

"I did."

"Then..." Rui Si paused.

"If you don't want to tell me, then I don't need to hear it," Jiaojiao yawned and patted her on the back. "Shouldn't we be sleeping? We have more work tomorrow."

The two entered the sleeping area as well, settling down by their secluded corner, far from the others.

"Good night, *da jie*," Rui Si whispered. Only the barest shape of her form discernible in the pitch black.

*You really don't care about what they were talking about?* Guang Qiu asked suddenly.

Jiaojiao cracked open her eyes. The ball floated, a spot of light in her vision, though he cast no light onto his surroundings. Like a selfish star that shared no light.

*You don't talk to me all day, but disturb my sleep? Excellent,* Jiaojiao mocked.

*They were talking about a girl.*

*So? Aren't you always telling me not to meddle? Why fixate on this?*

*You should ask them about her.*

*Hehe. I can't decide, are you trying reverse psychology or something?*

Guang Qiu fell into another prolonged silence. Jiaojiao rolled her eyes in the night and rolled over to turn away from the ball. What an eyesore.

The next day, Jiaojiao fell into the same routine she had the past three days, though her breakfast was less miserable than the past. She and Rui Si continued braiding and knotting, Min Tong a discontent shadow plaguing the corners of the room. He'd made attempts to rally the children for another mudslinging, but none of them listened. They weren't idiots, they knew where the food came from.

Midday rolled around. A strange squeaking noise came from the entry to the temple courtyard. Jiaojiao frowned and looked out the door. A bruised and battered Tu Wenfeng slouched into view, dragging a rickshaw with a half-broken axle, its left wheel rolling erratically.

"Oh, I was afraid of this," Jiaojiao sighed. 

"Tutu!" the children screamed and crowded around him. 

A few seconds later, Granny Hua came in a panicked scurry, as much as an arthritic old woman could scurry, anyway, her hands still wet from doing laundry. "Wenfeng, what happened?"

The teenager didn't answer, letting go of the cart shafts with a thud, he avoided eyes as he came up to Jiaojiao, favoring his left leg.

"You look terrible."

"The man hired a thug to beat me up," Tu Wenfeng confessed in a low whisper. "He even bribed a guard to look the other way when they came to stop them."

"Who won?"

"I'm sorry?"

"Who won the fight?"

Tu Wenfeng gave Jiaojiao a confused look. "There was no fight. I didn't fight back."

*Excuse me?* Jiaojiao thought. *This is the feared Black Wind as mentioned in the books?*

*I did warn you to not interfere with the characters before the time was correct,* Guang Qiu said smugly. *Black Wind? I won't be surprised if he becomes Pink Breeze at this rate.*

"Nevermind," Jiaojiao waved a hand. "How badly hurt are you? Can you still pull a cart tomorrow?"

Tu Wenfeng looked up, his pride bruised, face gray. "What use is it? That man will beat me up again if I try to sell tomorrow. He might even have me killed."

"Idiot," Jiaojiao scoffed. "Are you so dumb that you can't even think of moving to another area?"

Tu Wenfeng paused, eyes lighting up. "That's right, there's no way he can cover the whole city." He frowned. "But that area was the most busy. I won't be able to make the same amount of money if I go elsewhere. Besides, what if this happens again?"

"It probably will," Jiaojiao agreed, "but what's the use of worrying? All we can do is take each day as it comes. We are mice living in a world of giants."

*Heh, at least you have perspective,* Guang Qiu said.

"Tu Wenfeng, I've proven I'm not just a fool who talks too much but now, haven't I?"

Tu Wenfeng scowled. "What do you want me to buy now?"

"Heh, this miser. You need to spend money to make money! How many times have I told you this already? Isn't that mobster the best example?"

"A mob what?"

"That evil boss I've yet to meet," Jiaojiao smiled and touched her chin. *I wouldn't mind having a* talk *with that fellow once I'm no longer a cripple.*

*You won't fix that poison without the artifact,* Guang Qiu reminded.

*All things in their time.*

Jiaojiao sent the limping Tu Wenfeng out of the temple once more on an errand. Granny Hua barely had time to wipe the blood on his face before he set off. She gave Jiaojiao a murky look but finally waved her hand with a sigh. "I have too much to do around the temple to worry about the business of the younger generation."

"Don't worry too much," Jiaojiao said without care. "I'm only sending him out the buy things. Even if he runs into those thugs again, he can just run away. He can run so fast dragging a rickshaw, I can only imagine how fast he'll be without it." 

The "feng" in Tu Wenfeng wasn't there for show.

"Besides, I doubt they'll come after him again on the same day."

Tu Wenfeng returned a few hours later, no worse than he'd been when he'd left. His bruises were turning an angry purple, but other than that...

"What took you so long?" Granny Hua asked, pausing in her sweeping.

Tu Wenfeng avoided the old woman's eyes. "I went to visit someone."

"Yanyan?"

"No!" Tu Wenfeng blushed.

Naturally not. Jiaojiao thought with a smirk. How could a young boy let his crush see him after getting creamed in a fight--er, one-sided beating.

"I went to see the madame to ask for an extension," he admitted with a bowed head. "There's just so little time, I'm afraid..."

"Tutu," Jiaojiao held out her hand.

Tu Wenfeng gave Jiaojiao a rare, pleading look. "Please, I cannot do this without your help."

Jiaojiao simply kept her hand out, palm up. Tu Wenfeng placed the parcel in her hand. "I still need fifty taels." 

Jiaojiao sat down at the low table,  spreading out the materials with a critical eye. The paper was far from the quality she could expect from her past life, but at least it wasn't toilet paper. Similarly, the inkstone and brush were inferior to what she'd used in the past.

She spent a laborious fifteen minutes grinding ink before the pigment was sufficiently thick. 

*You know calligraphy?* Guang Qiu asked in a strange, disbelieving voice.

*What's so surprising?* Jiaojiao asked, dipping the bamboo handled brush into the ink well. *I am after all, of Chinese heritage.*

*Chinese?* Guang Qiu sneered emphasizing each character. *Middle kingdom? You mortals really know how to self aggrandize. Frogs in a well, one and all!*

Jiaojiao shrugged. *Isn't this instinct? Perhaps some other being would look at you and say the same.* 

*Impossible! We are above--we--there is no one else!*

Jiaojiao didn't care for the ball's blustering. *Isn't there a saying? Mountains beyond mountains, heavens beyond heavens? How can you be so sure?*

*There simply isn't. You just worry about your own little mountain.*

Jiaojiao shrugged. *Wasn't I perfectly fine on my mountain? You're the one that dragged me off of it.*

*Might I remind you that--*

*Yes, yes, whatever. But I don't think you were really doing me a favor. After all, since the cycle of reincarnation exists, doesn't that mean you yanked me out of it?*

Guang Qiu fell silent.

*Hehe, for all your talk about not disturbing the cycle of reincarnation, you didn't seem to have a problem disturbing mine. Hypocrite.*

*You really think you are safe from punishment, mortal? I may not be able to do anything to you now but just wait--*

*Then I'm waiting,* Jiaojiao said and no longer paid attention to the fuming Guang Qiu.

Jiaojiao sat down on the low dining table, lips pursed as she labored in the flickering light of one of Chu Hua's precious candles. The old woman was so loathe to part with it, you might think Jiaojiao was burning money. She spent the evening and most of the night drawing on the paper, using a bamboo slip as a straight-edge. 

Slowly, with the inferior brush that periodically shed hairs, Jiaojiao sketched out a complex blueprint. Guang Qiu made several attempts to ask her about it, but Jiaojiao never deigned to answer him, too caught up in her work.

The next day, with shadowed eyes and aching shoulders, she sat in the back of the hastily repaired rickshaw as Tu Wenfeng hauled her to the craftsman's district, wobbly wheel squeaking with every revolution. Jiaojiao held her hand to her face, shielding it from the light and from curious eyes. She didn't have makeup to cover the mark on her face and she was too tired worry about what might happen if word got out that the notorious disfigured Bai Xingyue, "future empress" was seen riding in the back of a peasant's rickshaw. By the now the Bai family should have realized she was missing. Jiaojiao didn't have the spare brain cells to think of countermeasures at the moment.

She let the sounds of the busy city sift through one ear and out the other. The quality of this body was too terrible. Back on Earth, pulling an all nighter, while something she avoided like the plague because it did horrible things to the complexion, was not something that tax her like she'd been run over by a sixteen-wheeler. 

When the rickshaw finally pulled to a squeaky stop, Jiaojiao peeled open her eyes to see the sooty walls of a stone compound. 

"It's here," Tu Wenfeng said, swiping the sweat from his brow. "He's supposed to be very affordable, but his temper is eccentric."

Jiaojiao half hopped, half fell from the rickshaw, catching herself with her staff. As always, Tu Wenfeng stood to the side, refusing to help her, because god forbid he touch a finger of a woman other than his precious Yanyan, and even then he might not until the night of their hypothetical wedding. Ancient propriety was such a pain in the ass.

Inside the courtyard, the ringing of hammers striking steel grew louder, striking at Jiaojiao's eardrums and irritating her nascent migraine.

"Hello?" she called to the muscular man laboring at the forge.

"Hello?" she said again when he didn't look up.

The man didn't so much as twitch an eyebrow at Jiaojiao's presence, content to continue striking at the red-hot metal taking shape on the anvil. His arms and most of his chest was sweaty and randomly marked with ash. His short beard was dotted with scorch marks and Jiaojiao could only tsk in disapproval. The poor man needed a shower and a stylist. How could anyone go out with his beard so untidy and half-burned off she didn't know. 

Jiaojiao supposed she could afford to wait. Tu Wenfeng had warned her that the smith was eccentric. She sighed and leaned against the cleanest part of the wall to wait. Her leg was more or less healed, but she didn't remove the splint, not wanting to risk anything going wrong with her leg.

Almost thirty minutes later, the man put down his hammer, then started when he noticed Jiaojiao in his peripheral vision.

"I must be drunk?" he told himself. "Why am I seeing ghosts in broad daylight?"

"I'm human, thanks," Jiaojiao said. "Never seen an ugly girl before?"

"I've seen ugly. This is worse." The man drew a bucket of water from a nearby well and dumped it overhead. 

"Haha. Anyway, I have a job for you."

The man perked up in an instant. "What can I do for you?"

"I have a blue-print. Perhaps you can take a look at it and we can discuss prices."

They retired to the reception area. The man hunched his broad shoulders over the low table, sipping cold tea without a care as he squinted at the paper. Jiaojiao frowned at the cup he'd generously poured her and left it untouched.

"This paper quality is terrible."

"I'm poor."

"What is it?"

"Do you need to know to build it?"

The man crossed his thick arms. "I suppose not, but it would be easier to make if I understood its purpose."

"Its a lathe."

"A lathe?" the man looked up. "Is it some sort of magical device?"

"You can regard it as such."

"Very well, I can create something according to these blueprints. Ingenious design. Might I know the name of the man who created it?"

"Jiaojiao."

The man blinked. "Dragon, dragon? Very fierce."

"No, it's *jiao*." She wrote the character in the air.

"Do men generally call themselves Jiao? How strange."

"The man is actually a woman, and the woman is me."

The man stared at Jiaojiao, then threw his head back and laughed. "Very funny. Your master must be a very kind one if he employs the deformed and even allows them to make such jokes at their own expense."

The man's face then turned stern. "But I don't like disobedient servants. Get out of my shop and tell your master to send someone who knows how to conduct themselves."
