Jiaojiao's eyelids creaked open, groaning as the dawn light slashed at her retinas like a scalpel. Distant birdsong filtered through the thin paper window, radiating cold. She moved her arms then hissed as her numb limbs responded with a prickling stab. She was half-bundled in Cen Wei's bed, slumped over a crumpled hanfu she'd spent half the night altering. The other half she'd slept fitfully, her head full of vague shadows and sad smiles. Her dozing mind took in the scene in front of her.

For a panicked moment, in between sleeping and waking, she thought she'd been kidnapped and thrown into a dingy location for safe-keeping. Then she remembered.

Goddammit. She'd transmigrated.

Wait, was anything she'd just thought incorrect in essence? She shook out her dead arms, shooting a glare toward Guang Qiu, only to realize it was nowhere to be seen.

"Guang Qiu?"

*What?* came the instant, sullen reply. *Why are you making that face, mortal?*

Jiaojiao's crestfallen expression apparently irked the being, but she could not help hoping it had run out of battery or something. The fact that it had just been there, all night, waiting as she slept would never not be creepy.

"What do you do when I'm not awake?" Jiaojiao asked. "Did you just float there all night? Or did you sleep too?"

*I am beyond such needs. Don't mistake me for some feeble mortal.*

Huh.

*So don't get any funny ideas, mortal! I'll always be watching you!*

"Alright, simmer down, Sting." Jiaojiao stripped off her threadbare clothes, smirking as she sent the prudish Guang Qiu screaming out of the room. There had been a moment, as she worked, where she was astounded by how even her stitches were, given that they'd only been so-so in her past life. She chalked it up to the body's muscle memory, the previous occupant after all, probably did her share of mending clothes. Nevertheless, she was proud of what she'd accomplished in one night given that she had no access to a modern sewing machine, and she had done it by the light of an archaic lantern. 

Hence the current ache in her eyeballs.

"Worth it," she told no one, as she dressed in the well-tailored gray robes, altered from the least distressed set found in Cen Wei's chest. It fit her scrawny figure perfectly, and while nothing could really flatter a stick-figure, she at least didn't look like a child playing dress-up. She'd even created a form-fitting mask from the scraps, maybe out of habit after going through the plague in modern times. Normally she'd balk at the thought of wearing used clothing, but literal beggars couldn't be choosers.

*You spent all that time just for this? You* still *look like an impoverished peasant.* Guang Qiu ridiculed as he got a look at Jiaojiao's getup. 

As a self-titled fashionista, Jiaojiao wouldn't be caught dead in sagging, loose-fitting robes. Well, dead again, since she had already died. At least she had been well dressed last time around since she made a point of looking sharp for her audience during streams. She would have died again in shame in the afterlife if she'd been found in her slouchy pajamas. She-- 

Jiaojiao fell back onto the kang, shocked into silence.

*Mortal! Are you all right?!* Guang Qiu flew over, radiating panic.

"I just realized, Guang Qiu."

*What? What is it?*

"I hadn't finished my nails when I died," she turned to the ball, eyes hollow. "What if they buried me with half-done nails?"

Silence.

"And what if they dress me in something awful? I don't trust my mother's fashion sense at all! What if--"

*Idiot!*

"It's not idiotic to want a dignified corpse!" Jiaojiao gave the orb a scathing look. "Not that you would understand, not having a body."

*Is that something to be envied?* the ball sneered. *Even the best looking corpse becomes worm-food sooner or later.*

Jiaojiao was once again shocked into silence. She imagined that beautiful, perfect body of hers being boxed. Being lowered into the ground. Shriveling up and pickling in its own juices for years and years, decay stymied by embalming fluid. To the eventual collapse as rotting flesh split and cracked, unable to hold its integrity under the onslaught of time and a growing host of microorganisms.

"You bastard," Jiaojiao whispered, the ball's indignant rant about its need for respect drowned out by the ringing in her ears. It took five minutes for a brain to become unviable for resuscitation. How long had it been? Surely the body would have been found by now, along with whoever else had been unlucky enough to be caught in the gas leak. 

She and Devika lived in a converted warehouse, so just the two of them probably.

(This section better off in earlier chapters, don't mind me. Idiot author talking to self.)

Jiaojiao moved as if in a dream, the sights of her rotting corpse etched in her brain. She took a long detached glance at Cen Wei, lips blue and groaning and stuffed a ball of rags in her mouth. She secured the impromptu gag by fastening it behind the woman's head.

*Why?*

*She's waking up. What if she yells and alerts someone?*

Jiaojiao held her grumbling stomach. She adept at counting calories and would laugh if what she ate yesterday reached even a hundred units. Even so, her body didn't react to this much, being used to this level of near starvation, but this level of discomfort was enough to send Jiaojiao into a whining fit.

"I'm hungry," she told Guang Qiu. "What do I do?"

*Are you slow? Go cook some food!*

"How?" Jiaojiao asked. "I don't even know where Cen Wei got the water."

There was a fraught silence. *Are you joking?*

"I'm from another world? With running water and indoor plumbing? Can you blame me for being ignorant?"

*There should be a well nearby.*

"You mean I have to literally draw water? From the ground? With this body? Forget it."

*Then starve!*

"I already am!"

The two bickered back and forth as Jiaojiao located the stone bucket that Cen Wei had used as a stove the day before. Next to it was the basket of wormy vegetables and a bag of inferior rice. She eyed the offerings with disgust but she was too hungry to refuse. She could light the fire and worry about the rest later. The awful noxious charcoal lay in a hemp bag in the storehouse. Jiaojiao fished out several handfuls and threw it in the bucket.

"What now? Do I just start a fire with the fire-stick?"

*You need tinder, you imbecile.*

Jiaojiao threw over that another handful of straw, then lit it on fire with the fire piston. The straw caught quickly, but soon died out. The charcoal remained dead and unlit.

"What did I do wrong?"

*How should I know? I'm not a mortal? Do you think I bother with such trivial things?*

I'm going to die of starvation. I'll be the first to die of starvation after transmigrating. She gave Guang Qiu an angry look. "Where is the justice? Other transmigrators get magic powers, a wise grandpa mentor, harems or artifacts but all I get is a broken leg and an ugly face."

*You had an artifact! And you were the one who lost it!*

Breakfast a lost cause, Jiaojiao donned a straw hat and grabbed a wooden pole she'd found in the storehouse as a cane. She wandered through the moon door leading out of the courtyard, hoping to cadge a meal from the stuttering concubine.

She made her way in the direction of the neighboring courtyard, but stopped short and shrunk back when she saw a young man in fine blue robes speaking with the woman from yesterday. He handed her a drawstring purse, then saluted before taking his leave, passing towards Jiaojiao's position. She hastily hid behind the edge of the moon door, breathing strangled when the footsteps paused right outside.

Thankfully, the young man didn't seem interested in investigating and left shortly after.

Jiaojiao waited for another three minutes before she felt safe leaving the confines of Bai Xingyue's courtyard, sneakily hobbling over to her destination. She didn't relish the thought of running into nosy servants or other residents of the estate and answering questions about why the resident disfigured shut-in was out and about.

"G-good, you m-made it," the stuttering concubine said, ushering her into her residence. Jiaojiao swallowed her questions about the young man. It really wasn't any of her business.

Jiaojiao took a curious look at the courtyard. It was identical to Bai Xingyue's in size in layout, but in far better repair. Even so, the age and overall neglect could not be dismissed. 

It seemed that this section of the estate is reserved for those the Bai Family would prefer out of sight. No doubt the stuttering concubine was one such existence. Too pretty to throw away, but her speech impediment left her too embarrassing to be seen.

Jiaojiao's stomach gave a plaintive lurch as she laid eyes on the basket of steamed buns lounging on the low table in the reception room. The concubine caught her staring and tactfully gestured toward the table. "Please, sit down and eat."

"Thank you," Jiaojiao said, seating herself as gracefully as her damned leg would allow.

The two of them had breakfast in awkward silence.

"I didn't catch your name yesterday," Jiaojiao said, when she'd padded her stomach enough for it to stop screaming at her. 

"I am Hu Maoxun," the young woman said, looking down with a blush.

"I suppose I don't need introduction, if you've been watching me for as long as you've lived here."

The woman had the decency to blush. "I- it get's lonely here."

"It's fine, I'm not angry with you." Why would she be? It hadn't been her privacy being invaded for entertainment. 

"Perhaps we should get going," the woman said. "You don't have a lot of time."

They withdrew to the inner chamber where Hu Maoxun sat Jiaojiao down in front of an old vanity. 

"You c-cannot go out as y-you are," her eye shifted over the mark on Jiaojiao's face. "Your b-birthmark is far too r-recognizable."

Indeed, the second young miss of the Bai Family was known far and wide as a horrifically ugly monster. An ongoing joke for being affianced to the crown prince.

Jiaojiao's eyes sparkled as Hu Maoxun placed a lacquer box on the vanity in front of her and opened the lid. Porcelein containers lay within with different shades of powder and rouge. 

Jiaojiao looked from the containers of powder, each with paper seals untouched, then looked at Hu Maoxun's face. 

Fine, it could be said that some people are simply blessed and do not need makeup to look good.

Hu Maoxun took the brush and started to apply the powder to Jiaojiao's face but Jiaojiao interrupted. 

"Let me do it." Are you kidding? *Do you know who I am?*

Jiaojiao dipped the brush into the powder with an expert hand and began blending and dabbing her face, switching brushes with a dexterity that spoke of long familiarity. Hu Maoxun watched from the side, half in puzzlement and half in wonder as the girl's face went from horrifically disfigured to... well at least she was no longer disfigured.

Jiaojiao placed down the brush with a dissatisfied frown, turning her head to look back and forth. It would have to do, she supposed. The quality of the cosmetics were far from her usual standard. What she wouldn't give for liquid foundation and a beauty blender.

The two exited the residence and Hu Maoxun led her to a boarded up section of the wall. 

"This leads to the outside," she said with some embarrassment, moving the board aside with a blush. "You will have to crawl to get to the other side."

Jiaojiao looked at the hole. The wall was about six or seven inches thick, the other side covered with a shrub or bush.

She hefted her make-shift cane, forced a smile and gave Hu Maoxun a formal salute. "I can't thank you enough for your help."

"It's n-nothing. I grow b-bored by myself. This was an a-amusing m-morning," Hu Maoxun suddenly pressed a cloth pouch into her hands. "Please take this."

Jiaojiao looked down at it, recognizing it as the same pouch that young man had given Hu Maoxun that same morning. From the feel of it, it was filled with ingots. All this for an "amusing" morning? This little was considered amusing for the poor woman?

Jiaojiao took a proper look at the shy beauty, not know what to say. They didn't know each other at all, but Hu Maoxun was the first kind person she had encountered since waking up in this body.

"D-don't r-refuse, you will n-need the m-money if you w-want to fix your l-leg and retrieve the thing your s-servant pawned. I don't h-have much use for money..."

"Thank you," Jiaojiao said simply, bowing again, this time more sincerely. "I won't forget this."
