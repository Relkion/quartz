Bai Jing, assassin of 21st earth, terror of the criminal underworld, reaper of wicked and innocent alike, was dead-- murdered by her own lover for her mother's inheritance. The enchanting beauty laughed in madness as she jumped from the seaside cliff, taking her treasure with her. 

However, fate had other plans. Soul thirsting for revenge, she opens her eyes in the country of Lan as the browbeaten young miss of the Bai estate. 

This body cannot train in martial arts? No problem! My skills with acupuncture will make short work of this poison. 

Her sisters want to murder her? Not an issue. Can they keep up with my shaded walk? 

Does her fianc√© want to break off the engagement? Just scram to the side! 

And there is still that man! How dare he look down on me? With a taste of my paralysis needle can you still bully me?

Unstoppable! She has a secret pocket dimension in her bracelet and a manual of legendary alchemy. With a wave of her right hand, her enemies fall, with a wave of her left, her allies are yanked from death's grasp. With her unparalleled skills, she will conquer this new world. Her beauty--
