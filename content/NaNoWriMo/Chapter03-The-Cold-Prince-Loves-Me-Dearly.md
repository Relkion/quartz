"The Cold Prince Loves me Dearly?" Jiaojiao could barely get the words out through her upset. "You brought me here for this?"

*I fail to see what the problem is.*

"Fail to see the problem-- of course you would. You're not he one being forced to play out over five hundred chapters of nonsense!"

*Actually, it's over five thousand, but I didn't want to overload your puny mortal brain with too much information at once.*

*Lord, guanyin, yama, whoever, save me from this farce.* Jiaojiao slumped over the *kang.* A webnovel! Not only was this a webnovel, it was a badly written one too, with plot holes, repetitive plot lines and more tired tropes than she could care to name. Not only that, it was of the xianxia genre, heavily featuring a romance she found highly problematic. Not only that! There were *xian* and *gui* and whole bunch of other things she wasn't equipped to deal with. 

There was cultivation. That explained that angry girl's inhuman strength, and apparently her display of prowess was only the tip of the iceberg.

"Piz-dets," Jiaojiao muttered.

*What was that?*

"Say, you seem to have overlooked something very important, Guang Qiu."

*Guang Qiu?* The ball of light vibrated in agitation. *You are addressing me?*

"You are a ball of light and you refuse to disclose your name to the likes of I, so yes, Guang Qiu."

*The nerve! I am far more than some ball of light!*

"Anyway, Guang Qiu," Jiaojiao continued. "You seemed to have forgotten that an *entertainer* and an assassin have very different skill sets."

That's right. Bai Jing, the missing heroine, was an assassin. Not only was she an assassin, she was the supposedly the best of her kind, feared in the underworld of her original world as the embodiment of death. Her victims numerous enough to "circle the globe once." Jiaojiao was too lazy to inspect the math on that claim.

 Trained in the art of killing from the tender age of seven, she could kill you with a knife, she could kill you a spoon, hell, she could probably kill with both her hands *and legs* tied behind her back. And not only was she good at killing people, she was trained in both western and eastern medicine. 

She could kill with a needle, and she could similarly save lives with one too. At least, if the contents of the webnovel were to be believed.  

A merciless reaper with a heart of gold. Beautiful, treacherous, and cold. Cold at least, when it came to people other than her paramour, Fei Chen.

The same Fei Chen who apparently stabbed her in the heart and forced her off a cliff for some mystical inheritance.

Yikes.

Anyway, the recently murdered Bai Jing, understandably wrathful, had somehow revived in the body of also recently murdered Bai Xingyue, the same drowned body that Jiaojiao was currently wearing. And here was where the road split.

Bai Jing the assassin kicked Bai Xingwu and her two servants into next year,  laughing at their attempts to bully her. Then, she forced them to kowtow, beating their foreheads bruised and bloodied before sending them scurrying back whence they came, cradling broken wrists and broken egos.

Jiaojiao the influencer showed as much spine as a sea anenome and debased herself like the filthy mortal entertainer she was. 

*No, matter,* the ball of light said smoothly, *with me here, all your inadequacies will be immaterial.*

Jiaojiao gave a ball a thousand-yard stare and shuffled toward the bedroom exit, squeezing past the door barely hanging on by one hinge.

*Where are you going?*

"This mortal has some mortal things to do."

*What things can possible be more important than the mission?*

"Bathroom!"

*Bathroom?*

"It's called a bladder you disembodied simpleton."

She left the sputtering Guang Qiu to get upset over her directness, hobbling past a dusty room, equally sad as the one she'd just left, with old worn furniture and cobwebs. Jiaojiao quickly located the front door to the building, it wasn't hard, the mean trio hadn't bothered closing the doors after themselves. The pain in her leg was a persistent presence as she leaned against the cracked doorframe and peered outside. 

In the midday light, a neglected courtyard came into view, weeds peeking out from between the flagstones. A half withered apricot tree twisted overhead, casting curled shadows on the walkway. Dead leaves filled the corners of the patchy walls, spotty with flaking limestone plaster and creeping moss. There was even a sizable hole in the wall directly across from her, large enough to stick her head through.  A second and third building, smaller than the main house stood off to the side, in an equal state of disrepair and entropy. A small pond with a wealth of duckweed and choked with clumps of algae completed the depressing scene.

Jiaojiao ignored all this in favor of the shabby outhouse in the far corner of the courtyard, also missing roof shingles and with a door that hung crookedly in its frame. 

*It'll be fine!* Jiaojiao pep-talked herself, *it will be like camping. We did that once, right?* 

It had been an expensive company retreat with running water, yoga instructors, and h'orderves but *let's not think about that right this second.*

Gritting her teeth against the stabbing pain in her right-calf, she shuffled over. It was only about twenty meters but it felt like twenty miles.

At ten meters, Jiaojiao was already wrinkling her nose at the smell. Delightful. Her face grew ever more pinched with dread as she neared the source of the distinctive aroma. 

*It's fine. I'm fine. Everything's--*

She wrenched open the door and gagged on the stench.Â 

After hesitating on the threshold for a good thirty seconds, silently choking on the smell, she finally gathered the remnants of her waning courage and hopped inside, shutting the door behind her. After a nerve-wracking ten seconds, fumbling with the unwieldy folds of her robes, she finished her business, then realized there was no toilet paper. She nearly died of shock on the spot.

Finally, she ripped off a corner of her robes to finally put an end to the horrible affair and dashed outside as quickly as her gimp leg allowed.

"That's it," Jiaojiao announced, incoherent with disgust. "I can't. Just no."

She drifted back inside the house, muttering to herself. "Isn't it just dying? I can just do it again."

*What are you talking about?* the ball of light floated over, emanating superiority.

Jiaojiao looked at it with the gaze of a man recently returned from the front-lines. 

Before Jiaojiao could tear into the ball for sending her to this godforsaken era, a noise came from outside.

"Aiya! What happened here?" A high voice cried. "Young miss! Are you all right? Young miss!"

Rapid footsteps, then a portly old woman dressed in gray robes came into view. Her face was plump with the beginnings of age-spots on her cheeks. Her wrinkled forehead creased with worry as she looked Jiaojiao up and down. "Yueyue! Did that awful second young miss come by again? You're not hurt are you?"

The old woman dropped her basket of vegetables, making tsking noises as she came up to take Jiaojiao's sleeves. "Why are you wearing your good robe? Why is it ripped? Did the second miss do this?" 

*These are the good robes?*

Jiaojiao tried to draw back, alarmed as the old woman took a hank of limp hair and folded it behind Jiaojiao's ear, but the old woman's grip was like iron. She was further dumbfounded when the woman *picked her up* by the elbows and deposited her onto the ruined *kang* not even batting an eye at the two mango-sized holes in the middle of the bed.

"Don't you worry, Yueyue, I harvested some good bamboo just the other day, you won't have to sleep on the floor tonight."

*Sleep on the floor?* Jiaojiao echoed shrilly in her head. *You better fucking believe that's never happening.*

Jiaojiao spent the next twenty minutes watching the old woman bustle about, having been deposited onto three-legged stool like a doll. The old woman pulled out an old stone bucket from somewhere and placing it in the middle of the courtyard. She proceeded to light some coals on fire, turning her head away when it spat out plumes of foul smoke.

"I spent this month's stipend on some charcoal," the old woman told her cheerfully. "You won't have to wear your padded jacket to sleep tonight."

Jiaojiao had no response to this delightful news.

As the old woman took out a dented copper pot and and cup of broken rice, Jiaojiao finally identified the old woman from the wealth of text swimming in her head. 

"Cen Wei."

The old woman peered over curiously. "What is it Yueyue? Are you feeling ill?"

Jiaojiao forced out a smile. "It's nothing."

"Yueyue! You're smiling!" The old lady threw down a handful of wilted vegetables and scurried over, frowning in worry. "You're smiling! Are you sure you're alright?"

*Damn, how miserable was this Yueyue that a smile would read as a red flag?*

The old woman fussed over Jiaojiao, turning her this way and that with her inhuman strength. Jiaojiao could only sit there and take it with her stick limbs and bum leg. She shot a pointed look at the ball of light floating off to the side, but it showed no reaction to her distress, seemingly content to watch her be manhandled. Jiaojiao was fast growing tired of being treated like a living doll by this old woman.

After the mixture of broken rice and handful of cabbage leaf coagulated into a depressing looking gruel, the woman banked the charcoal fire and ushered Jiaojiao back into the main room. She plopped her onto a flat cushion that has seen better days, jolting a wince out of her as her leg brushed the floor at a bad angle.

What followed was the worst meal Jiaojiao had ever had the displeasure of tasting. She hadn't had much expectation seeing the ingredients that had gone into the copper pot, but...

"Are these worm holes?" Jiaojiao asked, a tremor in her voice, holding aloft a boiled cabbage leaf with mismatched chopsticks.

"They were only two bits of copper at market, I got two whole baskets!" Cen Wei said, yellowed teeth on display with a wide smile. "We can have vegetables all every meal this week!"

Jiaojiao took one look at that expectant face, seemingly searching for praise, and laughed a little hysterically. "I'm full," she said finally, placing down her bowl on the uneven tea table, the surface pockmarked from years of abuse and missing half its mother-of-pearl inlays.

"How can you be full?" Cen Wei asked in disapproval. "You barely ate."

"Why don't you eat instead?" Jiaojiao suggested.

This was apparently the wrong thing to say as Cen Wei's expression fell.

"Have I done something wrong, miss?" Cen Wei asked in a wobbly voice, her creased hand coming up to wipe the tears collecting in her eyes. "I know it's not much, but I tried my best to come up with this meal."

"I'm just not hungry," Jiaojiao deflected. "You did nothing wrong."

"Those bastard kitchen hands cut off our daily meals again! They are too much! I almost thought I would have to beg in the streets so we wouldn't starve!" Cen Wei slammed a fist on the table. The legs groaned in protest and another inlay popped off the surface, but she paid it no mind, too caught up in her diatribe. 

"Or are you not feeling well because..." she gave Jiaojiao a commiserating look. "I didn't want to speak of it, because I know you must feel ashamed, but is this because of what happened yesterday?" Cen Wei asked with sniff. "My poor Yueyue! Humiliated in front of half the capital!"

"It's not--"

"It's that awful first miss!" Cen Wei said with a wail. "She set you up! She knew you didn't want to go to the palace feast, but she forced you into the carriage anyway! I know how shy you are about your birthmark! How could you possibly have gone to that feast of your own will!"

Jiaojiao sat back and watched the old woman degenerate into a fretful mess of tears and indignation on behalf of the absent Yueyue. 

*So noisy,* Guang Qiu finally spoke.

"So fake," Jiaojiao said.

"What was that, Yueyue?" Cen Wei said, looking at her sharply.

"Nothing, nothing," Jiaojiao said with a thin smile. "I was just saying how I don't feel like eating because of what happened yesterday."

Cen Wei stared at Jiaojiao for a long time, expression clouded. "Yes, Yueyue must still be in shock, after all you almost died in that pond."

Jiaojiao forced herself to eat the thin gruel, nibbling on a few mouthfuls of bitter cabbage leaves before the appalling meal finally drew to a close. Cen Wei didn't urge her to eat more, taking away the half-full bowl. 

She murmured some excuse about being tired, then excused herself to her room, maneuvering the broken door back into its frame with a grunt of effort.

"Guang Qiu," Jiaojiao said, when she was sure Cen Wei wasn't listening in.

*What?* the ball asked, having retired to the inner chambers with her.

"Don't tell me you didn't notice?" Jiaojiao asked incredulously.

*Notice what?*

"Are you blind? There's something wrong with Cen Wei."
