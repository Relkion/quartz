Jiaojiao, beauty blogger, skincare guru, and spokesperson for MEI cosmetics, was dead at the age of 23.

The internet celebrity was trending moments after her scheduled Friday stream ended disastrously, having collapsed on camera to the bemused gazes of her supposed fans, just moments from applying the last rhinestone to her bedazzled pinky nail.

**ChanelAddict_663:** Is she day drunk?

**EyelineSkyline_43:** this is fake

**BBL44:** so fake

It was however, not fake that Jiaojiao was currently sitting up in an ancient dilapidated bedroom with a distinct lack of modern necessities. From the scuffed corners of the _hongmu_ armoire, to the cracked surface of the low tea table with mother of pearl inlay, every detail screamed of bygone grandeur. The mustiness in the air hinted at age and neglect.

JIaojiao didn't react for a good ten seconds, staring here and there at the ratty paper windows, thrice mended and patched with ragged bits of cloth, at the exposed brown bricks beyond the cracked lime plaster, at the moth eaten covers over her too-small lap. She held up her bony hands, chapped, with yellowed uneven nails.

"Oh no," Jiaojiao spoke aloud. "I'm having a stroke."

Because, that could be the only explanation for this... this farce of a hallucination, right? She had only just been arguing with... who was it? Right, Superb_Ninja2394, defending her controversial decision to pair Galaxy Sunrise nail polish with hot pink stripes and gold decals. Why else would she be seeing this scene out of a half-baked period drama. It was a stroke.

A stroke. It had to be.

Because... what would be the alternative?

With mounting horror, Jiaojiao used her not-her-hands to touch her not-her-face. It was small, thin, and _unmoisturized_. _Who was this person?_

She didn't get to dwell on it further before the door to the bedroom burst open with a crack of distressed wood.

"Bai Xingyue, you slut!" cried a sweet young voice.

Framed in the doorway, with her leg still raised in a high-kick, was a young girl in a pink _hanfu_, perhaps twelve to fifteen years old. Pearled hairpins in the shapes of flowers and birds swayed with her movements. Her tender face was scrunched in a scowl that was more cute in the way of angry kittens and growling puppies, than intimidating.

Bai Xingyue? Is she talking about _not-me_?

The girl didn't waste a second rushing into the room, hand raised in a maneuver Jiaojiao recognized well as the classic posture for a slap, so well exemplified in Chinese harem dramas. She shifted out of the way, though her body responded much more sluggishly than she was used to.

The angry girl's pink embroidered sleeves billowed as her fist landed on the traditional _kang_ bed. Rather than bouncing off the woven bottom as Jiaojiao expected, that tiny palm blasted through in an explosion of bamboo shards.

"You dare dodge?!" The girl screeched, then pouted at the _audacity_.

Jiaojiao was too baffled to speak. What then? So should she stay still and get her head smashed in? The hell was with this strength? Was this ninety pound loli She-ra incarnate?

"I-- I'm sorry?" Jiaojiao finally rasped out, noting that the voice was not her voice, but what else was new? The moment the words were out of her-- _not-her mouth_, there was a brief buzz in Jiaojiao's mind. Jiaojiao frowned, raising a hand to her head. More signs she was having a stroke, surely.

"You think apologizing is enough?" the girl sneered, hand raised for another slap. "You slut. Why didn't you just drown in that pond? You think such lowly tactics would attract the crown prince? Naive!"

*What was this about a crown prince? So this is a historical drama? What dynasty? Is this a drama with wuxia elements?* Jiaojiao thought wildly to herself. How else to explain this girls strength? Her mind swiftly ran the gamut of routine hypotheticals. *Is this a movie set? Am I getting punked? Where are the cameras? Where is the crew? Is this a dream? Why am I even thinking about this? I could be dying right as we speak, brain cells withering from lack of oxygen! Are the paramedics even on the way?* Knowing her usual audience they wouldn't care to call for help even if it became obvious rigor was setting in.

_Doomed. I'm doomed._

The pink loli didn't take kindly to being ignored. Jiaojiao felt a distinct danger to her hallucinatory life as that white hand descended for another slap. She hastily rolled away though she felt serious doubts about her current situation. Surely none of this mattered even if her head did became roadkill? That is-- If she truly was having a stroke. The bed groaned as another hole appeared by the first.

"The crown prince wouldn't even deign to let you lick his shoes! You're a toad lusting for swan meat!" The girl sneered. "You should just kill yourself and save me the trouble of dirtying my hands!"

"The crown prince?" Jiaojiao parroted, curled up in the corner of the bed, bracketed by wall and headboard and and covered in bamboo slivers.

"You still have the face to speak of the crown prince!?"

Third slap incoming, Jiaojiao had run out of rolling space. She hastily raised both hands in a gesture of surrender. "Wait!"

The girl paused and regarded Jiaojiao in disgust. Behind her, two servants in plain blue robes had entered at some point and were staring at Jiaojiao in shaudenfraude.

"I have no interest in the crown prince," Jiaojiao said. It was the truth, who was this crown prince even?

"Hah! As if I would believe your lies!"

"Hold on!" Jiaojiao called, interrupting that hand descending like a guillotine. "I-- I've lost my memories!"

"Hah?" The girl glared, but the hand remained suspended.

"I... don't even know who you are?" Jiaojiao supplied.

The girl scrutinized Jiaojiao from head to toe, as if there would be physical signs to elude to the veracity of that statement. She leaned forward, staring into Jiaojiao's face.

"Don't believe her, young miss," one of the servants interrupted.

"She's just lying to escape punishment," the other servant agreed.

Jiaojiao met the girl's gaze straight on. "I really truly have lost my memories. I don't even know my own name."

"What a liar," the first servant laughed. "Just slap her to death."

"Slap her to death!"

_What is wrong with these people?_

"Hmph," the girl finally smiled. "So what if you don't remember? Now hold still so I can rid the world of an eyesore."

"You're seriously trying to kill her-- me?" Jiaojiao asked with doubt.

"You finally understand," the girl smiled. Objectively, it was a nice smile on a pretty face, but it made the hairs stand up on the back of Jiaojiao's neck.

"Can we talk about this?" Jiaojiao scrunched herself as far as she could go into the corner.

"What is there to talk about? You should have died back there in that pond. I'm just finishing the job."

Jiaojiao could only watch as that hand resumed its merciless descent, a harsh buzz began in her mind as the palm neared her unprotected face. The buzz reached an annoying crescendo then cut off with a wrathful pop.

A bright box bloomed into view, floating in Jiaojiao's vision like a phantom.

Simultaneously, the girl's descending slap suddenly veered off to the right and hit the wall with a crackle of broken plaster.

Though her face had narrowly escaped getting pancaked by mere millimeters, Jiaojiao could only stare at the floating box in befuddlement. It was a translucent screen with a block of white text scrolling past and looked like something out of a VR simulation.

The girl hissed and shook out her blushing palm, smarting from the impact to the brick wall. "You bitch, how dare you dodge!?"

The servants darted forward, cooing in distress over their mistress's hand.

"You wretch! How could you hurt the miss's hand like this!"

Jiaojiao was too distracted to answer, eyes riveted on the contents of that floating box that no one else seemed to see.

*Bai Jing woke in a dirty old bedroom...**

_Bai Jing smiled enchantingly as she caught Bai Xingwu's hand in an iron fist..._

_Bai Jing kicked the girl away with her slim leg..._

_Bai Jing slapped the impudent servant..._

_Bai Jing..._

"Who the fuck is Bai Jing?" Jiaojiao said.

The girl and the two servants stared agog at her outburst.

"Is there a Bai Jing in the family?"

"I don't think so."

"What is she staring at?"

"Maybe she's finally gone crazy."

"Heh! If I were her, I would've have gone crazy when I first heard I was a martial cripple."

"I would have just hung myself and ended it all."

"How could the crown prince have such a hideous toad for a fiancé?"

The servants tittered.

"Silence!" The girl snapped, still rubbing her sore hand. "Don't speak of the crown prince with your lowly mouths!"

The servants bowed their heads. Though chastised, the corners of their lips turned up as they snuck glances at Jiaojiao and the girl in pink, no doubt anticipating the ensuing carnage.

What bunch of manipulative she-devils.

Jiaojiao finally turned her gaze back to the bristling girl in pink, having finished digesting the contents of the floating box-- though not all of it made sense, she was beginning to get a hint of what was going on.

"Is your name Bai Xingwu?"

The girl curled her lip up in ridicule. "I thought you lost your memories?"

"So it is," Jiaojiao pointed to the ghostly text box. "None of you see that?"

"See what? Don't think pretending to be crazy will get you out of anything!"

"What do you want me to do?" Jiaojiao asked, exasperated. "Should I just lie down and let you kill me?"

"It would be your honor to be killed by me!"

Jiaojiao refrained from rolling her eyes. "What can I do so that you won't kill me?"

Bai Xingwu smiled, eyes crinkling in mirthful crescents. "Kowtow. Kowtow until I tell you to stop."

*And what if you never tell me to stop?* Jiaojiao rebutted internally. "Fine," she said instead with a diplomatic smile and crawled off of the _kang_, avoiding the wreckage of the girl's punches. She paused as her right leg gave a twinge in pain.

"What are you waiting for?" Bai Xingwu prodded, her smile mean and knowing.

Jiaojiao shuffled awkwardly to the dusty floor, then knelt, right knee now screaming in protest. There was definitely something up with that leg but she didn't currently have the time to address it. She took a distracted moment to admire Bai Xingwu's pearl-studded shoes, then lowered her head in the first kowtow, grimacing as the dirty floor neared her face. After a minute pause, her forehead touched the ground with an audible tap.

The harsh buzzing began anew. The girl gave her a pointed glare when Jiaojiao paused in thought.

_It's all a stroke anyway! Why am I worrying?_

Only Jiaojiao knew herself fairly well, and she wasn't imaginative enough to dream this shit up by far.

She was feeling pain in a hallucination-- maybe not a hallucination. Every sight, smell, and feeling was indicating that she might _possibly, not really, actually_ be having a stroke.

Jiaojiao grit her teeth and began her second kowtow. Ignoring the buzzing in her head. A new box of text popped up next to the first, bobbing insistently. She gave it a cursory glance, then covertly rolled her eyes.

_Bai Jing laughed as the servant wailed in pain..._

_Bai Jing broke Bai Xingwu's hand with a snap of her wrist..._

_"How dare you call this great aunt a slut? Are you speaking of yourself?"_

On her fifth kowtow, sweat began to head on her brow. Jiaojiao didn't enjoy pain and in fact usually went out of her way to avoid it-- like a normal person. This experience was swiftly becoming the most painful one she'd ever had the misfortune of encountering.

Jiaojiao touched her head to the dusty floor for the six time, the ground now damp with her sweat.

"Cry for me," Bai Xingwu suggested cooly. "Ask for my forgiveness."

With a sniff, Jiaojiao began to wail and covered her face with her dusty hands, pressing down on her eyelids until her tear glands welled up with physiological tears. Blinking rapidly, she choked on her sobs as she coyly looked down.

"Hah! You're so ugly," the girl said, "kowtow to me nine times and I'll let you go for today!"

The ground beneath her face was now dotted with tears as well as saliva and sweat. Jiaojiao wailed theatrically, face coated in dust and grime.

"Look how ugly she is."

"Hideous."

"So disgusting."

Jiaojiao sobbed noisily, slurping a disgusting mixture of snot and tears with every inhale and exhale. The buzzing had now grown to deafening levels and Jiaojiao could hardly hear the servants deprecating commentary. Jiaojiao's entire focus had narrowed to the pain in her leg, and she had begun shaking from maintaining her posture. Only a certain premonition was preventing her from breaking this farce of a scene.

Thankfully, Bai Xingwu soon grew bored of the spectacle and takes before swinging her head, hairpins flashing with lustrous light.

"Let this be a lesson to you, slut! Don't you dare covet the crown prince! He is the heavens and you are less than dirt," the girl spat, then left with a swish of her sleeves, leaving behind only the scent of jasmine. Her two servants shot Jiaojiao one last ridiculing glance, then scurried after their mistress, kicking the ruins of the door aside on their way out.

Jiaojiao's cries cut off with an abruptness that struck of artificiality. She wiped her face with a tattered sleeve and regarded her departing audience with a lackluster expression.

When the trio disappeared from view, so too did the buzzing cease.

The air grew heavy and solemn as Jiaojiao scanned her surroundings, hobbling back to the _kang_, now sporting two mango sized holes.

"All right, there's no one here," Jiaojiao said to the air. "Come out."
