Jiaojiao spend a few hours alternating between bickering with Guang Qiu and staring into the middle distance, itching for a phone or some form of internet connection. She had little time to slow down and contemplate her current situation since landing in the world of a webnovel and she hadn't gone this long without social media since the advent of facelog. Her fingers twitched, longing for an absent touchscreen.

*I wonder what my fans are doing,* she thought, mostly to herself. *How long has it been since I died?*

*Time flows differently between worlds. Only a day and a half might have passed here, but it might already be months or years later on that side. Who knows, they may have already forgotten you existed. Everyone you ever knew might already be dead.* 

Jiaojiao gave the ball an unimpressed look. *Oh, look, you've made me sad.*

*Does nothing affect you at all?*

*Would it please you if I were in emotional distress?* Jiaojiao tsked. *You and Cen Wei are birds of a feather.*

*Don't lump me in with that mortal!*

*Why this disdain for mortals, anyway? Is it so amazing, being an immortal?*

*Of course,* Guang Qiu floated overhead, light pulsing in smug waves. *Isn't it natural for the long-lived to be above those with ephemeral lifespans? Aren't humans the same with dogs and other lesser creatures? Though in my eyes, mortals are little different from a random cat or dog.*

*Oh spare me. For all your superiority aren't you still stuck here, babysitting one such mortal? Aren't you also relying on this mortal for your mission to go well?*

Guang Qiu choked on nothing. *I am not babysitting! My work is very important!*

*What? Are you implying that watching children isn't a worthy task? Do you have something against baby sitters?*

*I--that--it's women's work!*

*That's an interesting rebuttal, given that you've no body. Aren't you a sexless creature? Even asexual beings subscribe to the notion that  women and the work they do are lesser somehow?*

Guang Qiu paused. Jiaojiao waited for it to recover, as it was apt to fall into furious contemplation whenever it faltered during an argument. However, five, then ten minutes passed with no reaction from it.

*Guang Qiu?*

*What?*

*Are you sexist?*

*Of course not! You mortals are all equally lowly! What do I care if they are man or woman?*

*Then why did you say that baby sitting was a women's work and therefore unworthy for the likes of you?*

The being choked again, falling silent like a piece of code tripping in the same place.

*Interesting.*

A clattering came from the door of the house as three children warily edged into the room, each carrying a bowl. 

"Granny Hua said to give this to you," said a girl with a cloth tied over the lower half of her face. She placed down a chipped bowl filled with watery millet gruel.

The boy next to her threw down his own chipped bowl, this one filled with some greens, then ran out without a word. The second boy followed suit, almost missing the table entirely. The third bowl had a single beige mantou within, clinking stalely against he porcelain. Just looking at it caused Jiaojiao's teeth to hurt.

Jiaojiao looked at the offerings in silence. Should she be thankful that at least, it wasn't poisoned?

The little girl with the face covering blinked long lashes at Jiaojiao, staring at her mark. 

"You have something to say?"

"I don't think you're a guai!" the little girl blurted out.

Jiaojiao leaned the table and smiled. "You're not scared of me? Or maybe you have something even scarier underneath that veil."

The little girl flinched, hands coming up to clutch at her face cloth. 

"Why are you so scared? From one ugly girl to another, you think I would laugh at you?"

"It's not... I..."

"Let me tell you a secret. If you act like you are very ashamed of your face, then people will look down on you, but if you act as if you don't care, then they will respect you. Isn't this very funny? The more you care about something, the more people will find reasons to hurt you for it. Besides," Jiaojiao smiled. "Isn't it very fun not to care at all what people think? If they have a problem with how you look, then just drive them away."

The girl gave a wry look at the empty surroundings, the two boys having long excused themselves.

"It's not that bad, being alone," Jiaojiao said, poking at the mantou with a thin finger. "It's hard at first, but you get used to it. And sometimes, once in a long while, you might find people who like you even though you're not perfect. Sometimes, they're the ones that find you."

"Is it true, what you said about being cursed by a goddess?" the little girl asked. "Were you very beautiful once?"

"I was beautiful once," Jiaojiao agreed. "Do you believe me if I say I can be beautiful again?"

"She's lying! Don't listen to her! She's a guai!" A voice said from the doorway.

"Min Tong, you should leave before you get scared and pee yourself again."

Min Tong glowered. "Don't listen to her Rui Si, she's just tempting you so she can eat your spirit energy."

*What nonsense,* Guang Qiu said.

*Indeed. What part of me looks like it would eat children?*

*That girl doesn't even have spirit energy to devour!*

"What on earth?" Jiaojiao laughed. "I would never eat children. How unsanitary! But--and it this is a *big* but, if I *were* to eat children, why would I pick a scrawny thing like her?" she pointed at the three foot, twenty-five pound, Rui Si. "Wouldn't it be smarter to gnaw on something with more meat on their bones? Something with soft, fleshy, cheeks." her finger drifted to the white-faced Min Tong.

Rui Si laughter chiming laughter rang out as Min Tong scampered away, holding his face as if Jiaojiao were liable to jump up and take a bite out of them.

"How did he get so fat eating this garbage?" Jiaojiao poked at the mantou again. It wobbled in the black pottery bowl, clinking against the sides very much like a rock. She picked it up and rapped it on the table.

"You can soften it by putting it in the millet porridge," Rui Si explained. "Min Tong has good bones. Granny Hua says if he eats well, he be picked by the temple to become a monk."

"Oh? So she feeds him more than the other children?"

"If he becomes a virtuous monk, karma will follow. All those that helped him will benefit," Rui Si said, as if she were reciting something she heard often enough to callous her ears.

Jiaojiao rolled her eyes. "What garbage!"

"Granny--"

"I think Granny--" Jiaojiao bit off the rest of that sentence. "I think she doesn't know what she's talking about."

"Who are you to talk that way about Granny Hua?" said a voice from behind.

Jiaojiao jumped. Well, she tried to, but only nearly toppled over. She turned a glare on the frowning Tu Wenfeng. 

*When did he get back?*

*Only in time to hear you badmouth the old woman.*

"I just don't think feeding some children and starving others is a good practice," Jiaojiao said. "Or is this something you agreed to?"

Tu Wenfeng's frown grew deeper. "It's none of your business."

"Sure, whatever," Jiaojiao shook her head. "Did you bring what I asked?"

Tu Wenfeng turned to pick up a bamboo basket, then upended it over the table. Rui Si snatched up two bowls to save them from being overturned, but the mantou was cast aside by Tu Wenfeng's movements.

"This is all I could find."

Jiaojiao scrunched up her face in difficulty. The smell wasn't as bad as it could have been, considering the ancients employed the use of urine and animal dung to tan leather, but it wasn't great either. 

There was a variety of scraps, about half of them were useless, but Jiaojiao nodded instead. This she could work with. She began to sort through the mess, throwing aside the useless pieces and choosing the choice bits. Soon she had a sizeable pile of materials.

She waved a hand at Tu Wenfeng. "You can take the rest away."

He clenched his jaw, but did as she asked, packing away the discarded scraps to be dumped. "What will you do now?"

She held out her hand.

"What now?"

"Scissors! Or did you expect me to bite the leather in half with my teeth? Did you listen to my directions at all?"

"...Granny Hua has a pair. I will ask her for them."

Jiaojiao began the difficult task of providing sustenance to her body, spooning the millet porridge into her unwilling mouth with wooden spoon.

Rui Si, sat by her side, playing with the remaining leather scraps on the table. Jiaojiao could only lament on her behalf the absence of video games. And analog games. Games of any kind really. What did children or anyone do for entertainment in this godsforsaken world anyway?

Was it really all brothels and poetry readings? The endless days without technology and social media seemed to stretch out before her in a vast wasteland. How did people communicate? Did they just... talk face to face?

Tu Wenfeng returned with an old pair of rudimentary scissors. Just two pieces of metal bent into the correct shape and sharpened. They lacked any sort of ergonomic handle but Granny Hua must have had them sharpened recently because the leather gave way easily.

Jiaojiao abandoned the rest of her food, some soggy, tasteless, over-boiled vegetables she didn't know the names of. Under her deft hands, the leather became uniform strips of varying lengths and thickness. 

Tu Wenfeng watched on with a scowl, arms folded. "What is the point of all this?"

Jiaojiao threw aside the scissors. "Say, do you have some kind of mental problem?"

The teenager glared. "What?"

"First, you tried to rob me--"

Rui Si gasped.

"And when I ask you to cooperate in a business deal, this is how you speak me? Do I owe you anything?"

Tu Wenfeng turned very red.

"So I will ask again, do you have a mental problem?"

"Sorry," the boy said, head bowed. "I am just very anxious. If I don't get the money--"

"Yes, yes, yes, your precious Yanyan will become a prostitute. Very sad. Here, hold this end," she told Rui Si. Jiaojiao shook her head and started to knot and braid several leather strips. "But this rudeness? Uncalled for. And I have no patience for it."

"I--"

"Either shut up or go away."

The teenager fell silent, standing there like a rotten post. Smelly and unneeded.

"It looks so pretty!" Rui Si said. "Did Tutu really try to rob you?"

"Yup, he put a dagger to my neck and everything," Jiaojiao craned her head to show Rui Si the raw line that hadn't quite finished scabbing over.  "What?" She said when Tu Wenfeng made an awkward expression halfway between rage and embarrassment. "You dare to do it, and expect people not to talk about it? Idiot."

Tu Wenfeng finally couldn't bear it and stomped away, leaving the two girls to their devices. Children crowded around the doorway to get a look at what they were doing, but none dared to come closer.

It was two hours later, when the sunlight was no longer enough to work by, that Jiaojiao stopped work for the day. A pile of braided leather strips lay on the table between her and Rui Si, who had learned how to replicate the five strand braid quickly halfway through.

"That was very fun!" Rui Si said. "What is it for?"

Jiaojiao took a strand and looped it around her wrist, pushing the globe knot through the loop on the other end. A handsome bracelet lay against her thin wrist. She tsked. "Not quite my style, but it'll hopefully appeal to someone in this era."

"It looks very good!" Rui Si said. "Can I have one?"

Jiaojiao simply knotted one around her tiny wrist, looping it twice so it would fit. Rui Si gazed down at the leather cord, eyes sparkling. 

"When are we eating?" Jiaojiao yawned, massaging a crick in her neck. "I'm getting hungry."

Rui Si shot her a strange look. "But we already had *sun*?" 

Jiaojiao gawked. "Are you saying, you only eat two meals a day?"

Rui Si nodded, still puzzled. "Why? How many times do you eat?"

Jiaojiao didn't know how to answer. If she was still living her best life, back on modern day earth, she would ideally have five small meals a day, for the best metabolic performance. It seemed Bai Xingyue and the Bai estate had three meals, being nobles who could afford it. But children in the slums...

"The same as you," Jiaojiao said finally.

"If you are hungry, you can drink water," Rui Si said.

*Actually, your the body burns calories to process water so drinking more will only make you hungrier,* Jiaojiao thought.

*Hehe, you now know your wrongs?* Guang Qiu sneered. *If you were in the Bai Estate--*

*I would be sitting down to a poisoned meal with Cen Wei. Would you please shut up about that?*

Guang Qiu fell back into a sullen silence.

*What do you think happened to her?* Jiaojiao asked. *I left her tied up in the courtyard.*

Guang Qiu paused. *That stuttering woman would let her go? Wouldn't she?*

The two shared a moment of silence for Cen Wei, who probably woke up cold, confused, and concussed, not to mention trussed up like a pig in the middle of the courtyard where any random servant might walk by and see her.

Later, as they lay down on straw mats to sleep, the other children on the far side of the room, Jiaojiao spent a restless hour tossing and turning, paranoid about cockroaches crawling into her mouth. Finally, she pulled the face mask she'd sewn the night before and pulled it over her face before falling into a fitful sleep full of troubled dreams.
