*Mortal! Mortal!*

Jiaojiao cracked her eyes open, straining them in the gloomy light from the window. An insistent nagging ache in her stomach, translated itself as hunger after her cottony mind restarted. She must have dozed off in the post-adrenaline crash after that nerve-wracking conversation with the slash-happy Mo Wudi.

"What do you want Guang Qiu, I feel like *death*."

*Haven't you lazed about long enough? You've been napping for hours. It's the afternoon.*

No wonder she was starving. She hadn't had breakfast, or even had a proper dinner the night before, with Cen Wei rushing her off to bed after she'd failed to respond normally to conversation. Had she even had lunch yesterday? Jiaojiao thought back to that vague blot of memory. Wasn't it quite sad that the best meals she'd taken were in a slum orphanage since transmigrating? Should she just run away from this mess and become a nun? Granny Chu *was* rather overworked. Perhaps--

*Mortal have you become stupid?*

Jiaojiao groaned into the dusty blankets. "If there's something wrong with me, then it's one hundred percent your fault!"

*After you're done sulking, I want you to behave rationally! It's high time for bind the artifact and resume the proper path!*

Jiaojiao glared at the ball, then scanned the dim corners of the room for the bracelet she'd yeeted earlier in the day. It lay there where she'd left it, sad, abandoned, and with a layer of grey lint.

She picked it up with a huff and polished it on a handful bed covers. "This thing has a magical dimension inside? Why does it look like something I can buy for five dollars off of Taobao?"

*Don't dismiss it so eagerly! It's true appearance has been sealed!*

"What do I have to do in order to bind it?" Jiaojiao skimmed the contents of the webnovel in her mind, then scowled. "I have to cut myself? How unsanitary."

*Don't be so cowardly, it's just a prick of a finger! I'm not asking you to cut off a piece of flesh!*

"Why do I get the feeling that you wouldn't hesitate to chop off all my limbs if that's what it took?"

*Would you hurry up!?*

Jiaojiao took a full ten minutes before she found a needle and another stubby candle in another one of the cluttered drawers while Guang Qiu complained loudly and impatiently at her ear. She ignored the ball as she carefully sanitized the needle in the flame, then hesitated with the sharp point poised over her left index.

"If I perish of tetanus, it will be entirely your fault."

*Just do it, you coward!*

Jiaojiao turned her head aside squeamishly as she stabbed down, wincing at the prick.

*You survived the resetting of your leg, why are you so afraid of pain?* Guang Qiu mocked.

"Should I be ashamed of having a healthy fear of pain? Not everyone can be like your precious, masochistic Bai Jing."

The heroine of "The Cold Prince Loves me Dearly" had a taste for pain, both emotional and physical in Jiaojiao's discerning judgement. Not only had she jumped into a tumultuous romance with that psycho, Mo Wudi, but she often went on self-directed, torturous training excursions in uncivilized forests, deserts, and strange mystical lands, hunting creatures and fighting this and that.

It all sounded like such a terrible time. How did she shower? How did she go to the bathroom?

Not to mention her strange predilection for attracting trouble. She often brawled with every rando who took issue with her, getting chased by those with superior fighting power, getting smacked around to the point of spitting blood, or getting her body slashed open. 

Not only that, her cultivation exercises sounded like elaborate torture yoga. Even various tonics she ate to level up were described as "bone-breaking" and causing a "cold sweat" from pain. What a weird woman.

*Why do I feel like you are thinking bad things about me?* The ball asked suspiciously.

"Probably because I am. Is something supposed to happen?" Jiaojiao asked finally, some thirty seconds after the drop of blood had fallen onto the bracelet.

The ball hovered closer to the bracelet. *It's... maybe it just needs some time?*

A few minutes passed. Jiaojiao poked at the bracelet lying on the table in front of her.

*... maybe you should try again?*

"What? Next you'll be asking me to turn it on and off again." Jiaojiao complained.

Another prick, another drop.

The bracelet continued to lay there, blood splattered and unreactive.

"Heh, I'm going to laugh if it's broken or something."

*It can't be! Perhaps you just need to add more blood!*

Jiaojiao slapped the table. "Easy for you to say when it's not you getting stabbed over and over!"

*Then what could be the matter?!* Guang Qiu asked, voice buzzing with tension.

Jiaojiao watched, bored as the ball hovered over the bracelet, light dimming and brightening, no doubt interacting with the piece of wood in ways she couldn't understand.

A minute passed, then another. The light on the ball grew dimmer, as if each passing second was expending an untold amount of energy.

*...*

"It's broken isn't it?"

The ball *slumped*. If a ball of light could be described as depressed, it would be Guang Qiu, with it's brightness levels faint, it's subsonic hum thinning to a gossamer thread.

*This cannot be!* It whispered.

"What now?"

*The bracelet... has sustained severe damage. It shows traces of having been struck with a inter-dimensional turbulence.*

Jiaojiao swiped the bracelet from the table and brought it close to the candlelight. *There,* in the flickering light, between two abstract carvings, was a hairline crack.

*There is no sign of the guardian. The space within has been broken. The artifact is just a piece of trash now. Where could--*

Jiaojiao looked up with a smile as the ball choked off its own words. "You wanted to know where Bai Jing was, huh?"

Her smile took a more sarcastic curve as the ball froze, whether it was guilt or surprise, she didn't know, nor did she particularly care. "Relax, I knew it from the start that you were looking for Bai Jing. After all, I'll be the first to admit I'm not qualified for the mission you've saddled me with."

*You're not... angry?*

"In order to be angry, I would first need to have expectations or trust, and quite wisely, I've refrained from placing either on you." She tapped the damaged artifact on the table. "Too bad for you, looks like Bai Jing might have had an *accident.*"

If it were possible, the ball seemed to deflate even further. If it had a human body, Jiaojiao imagined it would be slumped over in defeat, head in its hands.

"Guess you're stuck with me now," Jiaojiao tossed the artifact in the air and caught it again.

Suddenly, with there was dim sparkle. A rectangular object slammed to the middle of the tea table, with gravid *whump*, bounced twice, knocking over the porcelain tea pot. Jiaojiao drew back to avoid the spillage of old tea leaves and stale water. 

*What is it?* Guang Qiu zipped over, as if injected with jet fuel.

Jiaojiao threw open the old window to let in a wash of gloomy light. The sun had failed to emerge on this day and the sky was heavy with unspilled rain.

"Looks like a book."

And it was *chonkin'*. Jiaojiao had seen encyclopedias with less pages. By eye, she estimated it was several thousand pages. The aged cloth binding was sepia with time, the pages visibly brittle. An archaic seal script was emblazoned on the cover in bold, frenetic strokes, as if the author was in crazed state while writing it.

Jiaojiao touched it with an index, the cloth covering felt like cool silk over a wooden board. Strange, alien plants were woven and embossed in the fabric. "Don't tell me..."

*It's the alchemic tome!* Guang Qiu cried. Jiaojiao held a hand in front of her eyes to shield herself from the blinding light the ball emitted.

It was like it had revived full health after chugging a rare elixir.

Jiaojiao squinted at the complicated script. Cracked open the cover, which came with a fragrance that reminded her of her grandmother and old traditional Chinese medicine shops. "I can't read a word of this."

*I can translate!* Guang Qiu cried, as if Red Bull had given it wings.

Jiaojiao looked at the bracelet again. If she smacked it around some more would it give her more surprises? She rapped it on the table, but it didn't spit out any more lost magical tomes. A shame.

*Would you stop that? Even if it's broken, it should still be treated with respect! Especially from a lowly mortal!*

"Didn't Bai Jing heal this body after taking a few old pills?" Jiaojiao asked. "You know this body is broken beyond repair even if we have the tome. I don't have the skills to make pills and even if you can translate for me, it will take me a long time to learn."

Guang Qiu's light dimmed again, as if Jiaojiao had harshly pricked its bubble of optimism.

*It is indeed a problem,* the ball sighed. *I did another scan of the bracelet. It seems there is no longer a dimensional space within. It is merely a low-grade storage artifact.*

"How do I use it?"

*Just hold it in your hands and have the intention to store or withdraw.*

Jiaojiao tried it. The book disappeared from the table. A few seconds later it reappeared with another *whump,* only to disappear again. This repeated a few times.

*Would you stop it? Treat the book with some respect! It's several thousands of years old! The knowledge held within is priceless!*

"Uh-huh." Jiaojiao paused in her antics to hold her stomach, which chose this moment to let out an indignant growl. "I'm starving."

*You mortals are so troublesome,* Guang Qiu sighed. *Go get something to eat. We have much to do!*

Jiaojiao was about to make her way to Hu Maoxun's in hopes of cadging another meal, when there came a tentative knock on the door of her residence. She frowned. She wasn't acquainted with many people and the ones off the top of her head, like Bai Xingwu, Mo Wudi. etc, were not the type to knock politely.

She warily made her way to the front door, swiping up the makeshift club on the way.

Bai Xingyun stood on the threshold, smiling sheepishly and holding aloft a straw basket that smelled like *meat.*

Jiaojiao hadn't had meat for *years.* Even before transmigrating, she had been vegan. And after transmigrating, she hadn't encountered meat, other than as a phantom fragrance on her various rickshaw rides through the city.

"What do you want?" Jiaojiao asked, even as her mouth sloshed with a traitorous flood of saliva.

"I was bringing lunch to Concubine Hu, and I had extra..."

Two minutes later, the two of them were seated on opposite sides of the tea table, Jiaojiao having silently renounced her vegan ways. She was too hungry to worry about dietary trends, and really, could her thirteen million fans call her out for it?

Jiaojiao ate without her usual grace, with her head bent ravenously over the steamed buns, full of diced pork, and mushrooms that tasted like shiitake, though the color was a bit bluer than what she was used too, once again reminding her she was in another world. The distinct flavours danced on her deprived tongue. How many years had it been since this body tasted meat? Had it ever tasted meat? The corner of her mind now devoted to Bai Xingyue's memories provided the answer that it had been as many as eight years.

Jiaojiao was too hungry to ask the boy too many questions. As for poison? Jiaojiao believed that there were easier ways to kill a defenseless girl such as herself, especially for an able-bodied young man like the one sitting across from her.

Why fuck around when you could just slap her dead with a palm? In fact, she had doubts as to why the Empress and Head wife Zhang were using such inefficient methods to off a mere girl with no martial expertise to speak of.

When she had eaten three buns and was feeling a bit more human, Jiaojiao pulled over the bowl of steaming hot soup the boy presented to her and brought it up to her lips.

"Be careful, it's hot."

When she had finished the satisfying bowl of chicken broth, a black chicken leg waited a the bottom. She pushed it aside then gave the boy a strained smile, wiping the grease from her lips with a provided handkerchief.

"So, why are you really here?" Jiaojiao asked.
