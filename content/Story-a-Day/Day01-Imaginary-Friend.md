Soft, warm sunlight streamed through the open French windows into a pink nightmare. Everywhere Keith looked was another shade of this color, it's very existence a prickling anathema to his black, punk-studded leather. The chains on his boots and pants rattled as he shot up from his seat, confused, alarmed.

A little girl sat across from him at a miniature table, also pink, with fake white flowers placed in a plastic vase, surrounded with a bubbly plastic tea set.

"Sit down!" the girl said, round face pouted. "Drink tea!"

"What the fuck--" 

Keith sat.

He tried to stand again, only to find his chain bedazzled ass glued to the tiny plastic chair, his knees almost to his ears with how far he was bent in half. In numb bewilderment, he watched as his black gloved hands picked up a minuscule pink tea-cup and brought it to his wind-chapped lips.

The little girl's eyes brightened like gems. "Good job, Kiki!"

Keith was panicking. One second he was merging into another lane on the I-90 and the next he was having fake tea with a little blonde girl, surrounded by stuffed animals, with the scent of cheerio dust in the air.

It was hard not to come to the worst conclusion.

"Pour tea!" the girl ordered, pudgy finger pointed imperiously.

Once again, Keith found his gloved hands moving without permission, despite his two hundred pound frame straining to the contrary, he found himself lifting the pink teapot to mime pouring into the little girl's outstretched cup.

"Fuck me!" Keith said.

"Don't shout!" the girl scolded. "No shout inside!"

"Don't tell me what to do, aight?! Am I dead? I'm fucking dead! What is even happening right now?" Keith's head swiveled back and forth, taking in the child's bedroom, full of plushies and picture books.

The girl's bubbly laughter echoed in the soft room. "Fuck!" she echoed.

"Shit!"

"Shit!"

"*Motherfucker!*"

"Mothafucka'!"

And so it went for the next half hour. The girl would order Keith to perform some action, serve the other participants of their tea circle some tea, plate some plastic scones, or cut some pretend cake. Despite his best efforts and shouting his face blue, the girl would not *stop*, bouncing excitedly in her seat with each faithfully executed command. It was a *trial.*

"Enough of this bullshit!" Keith roared as his hands dutifully sliced at a squeaking tomato with a plastic knife. "Just send me to hell! What is this even?"

"Bullshit!" Julie parroted amongst a peal of giggles.

"Julie?" said a woman's concerned voice. "Where did you learn that? Who are you talking to?"

A head of blonde hair popped into the room, identical in shade to the little girl's. The little girl, pointed across from her at Keith. "Kiki said it!"

"Who's Kiki, sweetie? Is it your new friend?" the woman asked skeptically, a vein protruding from her forehead. "I swear, when Herman get's home we are going to have a *talk*."

The woman's eyes glanced past Keith's form, confirming his worst suspicion.

"I'm a fuckin' ghost? No hold up, an imaginary friend? Da fuck does that even work?"

"Fuck!" Julie echoed again, setting off a giggling fit. "Kiki so funny!"

"Honey, you can't say that word!" the mother said, face taut with panic.

The girl sipped her tea with a smile. "Don't tell me what to do, mothafucka'!"
