## Story a Day
I have a feeling I'm going to regret this.

After NaNoWriMo April 2022, I decided to jump on [Story a Day-May 2022](https://storyaday.org/category/inspiration/may-2022/).

## Goals
Minimum of 500 words and a maximum of 2000. If there are prompts that resonate with me, I may flesh them out further after the month is over.
