A girl and a glowing ball stood over the prone form of an old woman in a deserted courtyard. The two stared down at the bound figure in silence, neither willing to be the first to speak after their apparent fall-out.

*What do you intend to do with her?* The glowing ball asked finally. 

*What can be done?* Jiaojiao answered in a clipped manner. *I'm not going to kill her, don't ask me to do it again.*

*We can't just leave her here,* the ball protested. *She's going to wake up eventually. What will you do then? What if she attacks you? Then what? With your current body you won't last two slaps from her. Even though this old thing is the bottom of the barrel in terms of strength, you are more feeble than a chicken.*

*Don't put the faults of the body on me. It was in this state when I got here.*

*And your original body was any better?* The ball sneered. 

*It could at least walk ten steps without getting dizzy.*

*We seem to have gone off-topic,* the ball said. *What will you do when she wakes up?*

*Well, if you want to see that damned bracelet again, I'm going to have to ask her what she's done with it.*

The ball fell silent, strangled.

*If I'd gone ahead and killed her like you wanted where would I even know to look? Truly stupid.*

*Mortal! You will show me the respect I'm due!*

Jiaojiao shook her head, then limped into the store room again, nearly tripping over a broken hoe. A bygone tool for a bygone time when the courtyard still had a viable garden she supposed. Further rummaging revealed more moldy twine and some rags that might have once been linens. Jiaojiao held them at arms length, dropping them in a pile next to Cen Wei. 

Jiaojiao located a pair of rusty scissors in Cen Wei's quarters and snipped the piles of cloth into lengths that could be used to further bind the old woman. She made a game of cocooning the unconscious Cen Wei in swathes of smelly rags, grunting as she rolled the woman this way and that, taking petty revenge for all the times she'd felt belittled as she was manhandled by the old woman in the past day.

*I think that's enough* the ball interrupted. *She is but a martial apprentice. This should be more than enough to hold her.*

Jiaojiao nodded, wiped the sweat from her brow with her sleeve, then dusted off her hands. She grabbed the bucket full of dirty dish water with difficulty and lugged it to the prone Cen Wei, dragging a trembling leg behind her. All the activity had set it afire with pain, but Jiaojiao grit her teeth and bore it. With more precarious maneuvering, she took a bowl and used it to splash dirty water onto the old woman's face.

The woman groaned, but did not wake. Another splash of water yielded similar results.

*I think I might have hit her too hard.*

*Well done,* the ball said sarcastically. *If you've killed her after all then what? After all that talk of not killing, you might have done the old woman in anyway. Splendid!*

Jiaojiao frowned and lifted one of the old woman's eyelids. Her pupils were blown out, and slightly uneven in size. She let the eyelid snap shut, and pushed down a very very slight pang of guilt.

*Well, I'm no expert, but she seems concussed. I think she'll be fine. From what I understand, it's rare for you cultivators to die of something so small. Didn't people in the book bounce back from much worse?*

*You're not wrong,* the ball said after a long moment. *I did a small scan. She will most likely be awake by noon tomorrow.*

What was this scanning business? Jiaojiao wondered to herself. 

"Ex-excuse me."

Jiaojiao turned to see a face peering at her and the fallen Cen Wei from the hole in the courtyard wall. The same face she'd spotted earlier in the day.

"She fell," Jiaojiao said.

The face didn't seem too know how to respond to this. "Th-then, you-- I--"

*Excellent excuse,* the ball said. *I think she believes you.*

"What do you want?" Jiaojiao asked.

"I-I was just..." the face sputtered. "I-- I know she's not a g-good woman. I saw y-you hit her, b-but don't w-worry, I w-won't tell anyone."

Jiaojiao limped closer to the wall. The face seemed taken aback, and almost seemed ready to make a run for it at her approach. 

It was a beautiful face, delicate and smooth, with sparkling eyes, thought they were currently darting back and forth nervously. The young woman had red lips and even teeth. She was a great beauty, and Jiaojiao could not help staring, trying to rank the young woman on her personal list of outstanding faces. It was even more impressive given that plastic surgery was non-existent in this world.

"Top twenty for sure."

"W-what?" The woman blinked at her. 

"It's nothing."

*Who is she?* Jiaojiao asked Guang Qiu.

*...I don't know,* the ball responded after a long moment. *I don't think she is mentioned in the book at all.*

"Wh-what are y-you going to d-do now?" the woman asked, anxiously holding an embroidered sleeve to her mouth. "That old s-servant has been b-bought off by Head W-wife Zh-zhang. Sh-she won't b-be h-happy..."

*You need to stop speaking with her,* the ball cautioned. *You aren't supposed to meet this person at all.*

Well, now she *had* to speak to this woman!

"Who are you?"

"I-I'm," the woman jolted back as if shocked. "I'm a con-concubine of Family Head B-bai. I m-moved in-into this c-c-courtyard l-last month."

What a way to refer to your own husband. Jiaojiao had almost forgotten that this was an era with very unbalanced gender roles. A man could own as many women as he could afford while a woman... heh. Plumbing didn't exist, but the patriarchy was alive and well!

"Bai Qinghan?" Jiaojiao fished the name from the text in her head.

The woman's eyes widened. "Y-you can't sp-speak your f-father's n-name like that! It's im-improper!"

Jiaojiao almost rolled her eyes, but didn't want to further scandalize the stuttering beauty. What if she bit herself?

"Why did you call out to me?" Jiaojiao asked instead.

"I was w-worried about y-you."

Jiaojiao wasn't sure she believed her. If she'd moved into the courtyard a month ago, then she must have seen her fair share of Bai Xingyue's suffering. "Why now?"

"You- you've k-kicked a h-hornet's nest now, b-by acting against the old w-woman. Head Wi-wife Zhang won't l-let this go. Y-you are in d-danger."

Head Wife Zhang. What was she, some kind of end boss? "I was always in danger."

"Y-you've never f-fought b-back before today. It's d-different. Y-you're," the woman gave her a meaningful gaze, "you're d-different."

"I didn't have a choice. She was poisoning me and refused to get a doctor to look at my leg."

"Oh," the woman ducked her head. "Th-that's awful of h-her. I a-always thought sh-she was a t-terrible person. Th-the way she tre-treated you."

*Did you hear me!?* Guang Qiu roared. *Stop talking! Don't interact with irrelevant people!*

"I actually do need help," Jiaojiao said. "Can you find a way to get a doctor to me?"

"I--" the woman looked down. "I-I'm s-ss-sorry, but I c-can't do that."

Tsk.

"B-but, I have a way to g-get you o-out of the e-estate."

Jiaojiao smiled. 

"B-but I d-don't think y-you should do it," the woman's eyes blinked rapidly. "It's not a s-safe place out there for a y-young lady."

Jiaojiao gestured at her face. "If you're worried about people taking advantage of me, as you can see..."

The woman blushed charmingly, blood red and beguiling. "I-I'm--you--" she looked anywhere but at Jiaojiao's face. "Being b-beauti-f-f-ful isn't e-every-thing."

Jiaojiao dissected her words, wondering why the woman was blushing for a dumbfounded moment. Was it because Jiaojiao spoke of being assaulted? Because she was embarrassed on Jiaojiao's behalf for her ugliness? And how dare she say that? Beauty was everything!

Jiaojiao built a career from beauty, and felt a bone-deep irritation at hearing this statement. Maybe the woman could feel how hypocritical she was being, speaking to her with that face?

Well, whatever, it wasn't really any of her business. This was after all, *not her face.*

"Cen Wei pawned something really important of mine today," Jiaojiao said after an awkward silence. "Do you have any idea where she might have taken it?"

"Oh, well, " the woman played with a strand of her hair, brow furrowed delicately. "I'm not sure, but I think my first guess would be to try Yixin street. It has the most pawn shops. If you ask one by one, you are bound to find it sooner or later?"

*Good job, mortal! The end is in sight!* Guang Qiu cried, pulling an abrupt one-eighty.

*Yeah? What happened to "don't talk to irrelevant people" huh?*

Guang Qiu didn't dignify her with an answer. 

"How long is this street? How many pawn shops are we talking?"

"Well, it can't be more than fifty shops, surely?"

"*Fifty shops?*"  Jiaojiao echoed incredulously. "Is the city nothing but pawn shops?"

The woman laughed, a delightful clarity to her voice. "Have you never been into the city? There's--" then her eyes darted to the mark on her face and her laughter died. "I'm s-sorry, I sh-shouldn't laugh. The c-city is very l-large. Yi-yixin street is nothing b-but a t-tiny c-corner of it."

"Great, splendid," Jiaojiao grumbled. "I suppose I'm expected to get there on foot?"

*Mortal, you cannot balk now. The artifact is of the utmost importance.*

"You c-could always hire a r-rickshaw," the woman said with a sympathetic glance at her leg. "You c-can p-probably sneak away f-for a d-day with no-no one noticing. Unless of c-course the th-third miss comes l-looking for you."

Jiaojiao shook her head. A little girl with a misplaced crush was the least of her concerns right now. 

"How will you get me out?"

"Come to my courtyard tomorrow morning. This section of the estate is not in good repair... anyway, you will see."

After that, the face in the wall disappeared from sight. The sun was setting, throwing gloomy shadows over the lonely courtyard. The dried leaves rustled in the corners of the walls when a stray wind teased them, sending a rasping whispers echoing along the empty space. Cold blew in with the dusk, Jiaojiao drew her shoulders up to her ears, an insistent ache troubled her bad leg with the drop in temperature.

She took a disinterested glance at the prone form, stewing in dirty dish water in the middle of the courtyard. Sympathy was hard worn when she remembered how her own body had spent the last night in sopping wet clothes. Those two "meals" that old woman had fed her didn't help her case either.

"Good night, old woman," Jiaojiao said, draping her moldy blanket over Cen Wei before entering the servant's quarters and throwing the door shut behind her.

*You're going to just leave her out there?*

"I can't move her with this leg, you want to give it a try? Besides, didn't you want her dead? She's lucky I gave her a covering at all," Jiaojiao said testily. As the dark encroached, Jiaojiao fumbled for an old pottery lantern, sporting hairline cracks. It was nothing more that a dish with congealed animal fat, a half-burnt cloth wick sticking out the side. 

"How do I light this?" Jiaojiao asked Guang Qiu.

*Stupid mortal, use the huo zhe zi!*

After some condescending instructions, Jiaojiao managed to use the antiquated old tube to produce a flame and touch it to the lamp wick. Jiaojiao squinted in the flickering light, displeased at the inadequate light levels and the smell of rancid fat sizzling away. She sorely missed modern lamps.

"How do people live like this?"

*Stop whining, it's just a little dark.*

"A little dark?" Jiaojiao shook her head, rummaging in Cen Wei's things for a needle and thread. "People would go blind working in these conditions. The eye strain is unbelievable."

*Are you planning on staying here for the night?*

"It's not like the original occupant is using it. Besides, it's far cleaner than that mess in the other residence-- don't even start, I know what you're about to say, but why do I have to live in that miserable shack? Even Bai Jing didn't sleep there."

*Heh, you have the gall to speak of Bai Jing?* Guang Qiu hovered over Jiaojiao, it's smoky form gloomy like a thundercloud. *Bai Jing would have bound the bracelet right now and contracted the White Tiger guardian. She would have entered the space and spent the night there!*

"*Not Bai Jing*," Jiaojiao sang.

*If you had done something instead of letting f the bracelet slip through your fingers--*

Jiaojiao turned a deaf ear, busy inspecting the primitive sewing kit laid out before her. It came nestled in a plain wooden box, but all the necessary tools were there, including a set of metal needles and some plain off-white cotton thread. They weren't comparable to modern tools, but they would have to do.

*--never in all my years have I seen such incompetence! I... what are you doing now?*

"Huh? Isn't it obvious?" Jiaojiao smirked, expertly threading a needle. "I'm doing what I do best."
