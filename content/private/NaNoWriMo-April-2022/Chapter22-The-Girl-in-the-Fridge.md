How often were characters fridged as ruthlessly as Bai Xingyue? Jiaojiao wondered.  Not only did the poor girl get scarely a mention at all in the book, other than as a waste, a cripple, and an ugly toad who yearned unfittingly after the crown prince? Who was she really? No one knew. No one cared.

Bai Xingyue, by all accounts should have led a blessed life. She was born in luxury, status, and with superior body qualities envied in her world. An auspicious cloud hovered over the estate on the day of her birth, heralding that a child of great fortune had been born to the Bai family.

The empress, in her haste to pair that fortune to her firstborn son, had bestowed an imperial edict ordering the future marriage of the crown prince and the infant, who barely had time to cry out before being doomed to a fate of greatness.

At least that should have been the case.

In actuality, Bai Xingyue's misfortune began before she was even born. Her mother, Mu Haoru, was the premiere daughter of the Mu clan, with a stellar upbringing, background, and beauty, she could have had her pick of any of the young men in the capital's noble circle.

House Mu's lineage was at least several hundred years older than House Bai, who could be considered something of an upstart. Bai Qinghan, current head of the Bai family, and Bai Xingyue's father, was political rivals with her maternal grandfather, Mu Kangcheng. Prior to Bai Qinghan taking over the reigns, the Bai family idled as minor nobility for generations until the ambitious young Bai Qinghan startled the court with his groundbreaking policies. The emperor was quick to promote such a bright up and coming star to his inner circle.

Who knows what happened, maybe it was *love*, but Mu Haoru’s critical thinking functions blue screened upon sight of Bai Qinghan’s chiseled jaw. Despite protests from her mother and her father, she insisted on marrying into the Bai family. Despite having the qualifications to be a main wife of a family of comparable standing to Bai, she insisted on suffering as a concubine. Not to mention Bai Qinghan was at least a decade her senior, but such things mattered little in this world.

Bai Qinghan's wife, Zhang Qiuliu was a demure flower with a heart of a viper. Hu Maoxun married into the Bai family with all the pertinent formalities despite her father's protestations. But the day of her marriage was also the last time she would be happy.

It wasn't eight years later, at the age of twenty-three, that Hu Maoxun died of mysterious causes, With a last *"I'm sorry, my baby,"* she passed away one cold winter, leaving the seven year old Bai Xingyue to fend for herself. 

Bai Xingyue had been heralded as a young prodigy when it was discovered her pure fire element spiritual root was of the rare heaven grade. Unfortunately, after her mother passed, it was discovered she had no way of drawing in spiritual energy.

This was in actuality, Zhang Qiulu's shenanigans, but for some reason, everyone took this news at face value. Jealousy was a terrible thing.

Bai Xingyue's glory ended there. After all, in the noble circle, a girl's qualifications were the most important thing, to ensure that future heirs would carry good genetics and fortune, her imperfections were *unbecoming* of a future empress. Futhermore, she was disfigured by another poison that left an ugly mark on her face. Bai Xingyue's failing health began to make the rounds of the capital, but she *just wouldn't die.*

The position of future empress was not glory, but a gleaming red target on a little girl's back. Bai Xingyue had no way of protecting herself, and there was no one interested in protecting a little cripple with no prospects. It was a miracle she had lived to be fifteen at all.

The empress, too embarrassed to retract her edict, could neither stand up or sit down, hovering there awkwardly until Bai Xingyue's coming of age, where she apparently couldn't let the situation go on.

The drowning incident, Jiaojiao had no doubt was the empress's doing. To frame the thirteenth prince while she was at it was a matter of course. Unfortunately, while Bai Xingyue was truly gone, Jiaojiao was here now, and she had to deal with the mess left behind.

"Guang Qiu, what is this place?" Jiaojiao asked, in a rare moment of honest reflection. "Is this merely a virtual image produced from the ramblings of an author, or a real world?"

 Guang Qiu floated overhead, barely visible in the afternoon light after it's recent expenditure. *You already know the answer to that.*

"What a garbage world this is," Jiaojiao mocked. "Poor Bai Xingyue. Beyond giving Bai Jing an excuse to behave badly in the name of vengeance, what significance did her existence have at all?"

*Her fate was sealed the moment she was born,* Guang Qiu said. *She has already passed. Why obsess over her?*

"Why obsess? I am wearing her body, it would be strange not to care. How can I not wonder what she was like as a person. Isn't it mysterious? She is a ghost in her own family."

Jiaojiao smiled to herself. "You seem to idolize Bai Jing, but I think Bai Xingyue is a much more interesting character."

*How can you call her interesting when you don't know anything about her at all?*

"Isn't this precisely why she is interesting? What kind of personality can endure living in that courtyard for fifteen years?" Jiaojiaos eyelashes shaded her eyes as she looked down. "I don't doubt that it took a lot of willpower not to end it all. We know nothing about her, but in actuality her story defines Bai Jing's actions. You're not at all curious?"

*She has a role, but it is not as the main character.*

"Why though? Why celebrate Bai Jing and denounce Bai Xingyue?" Jiaojiao laughed. "Bai Jing might have had the training to do well in a martial world that valued strength, but if Bai Xingyue hadn't had her life cut short, what would she have become, given the time and training? What if she had been given Bai Jing's bracelet, for instance?"

*This conversation is a waste of time.*

"She obviously wasn't just some average girl. I think, maybe, she was just waiting. Waiting for an opportunity." Jiaojiao shook her head then grimaced. "I'm hungry. And I need to pee."

Guang Qiu hovered behind Jiaojiao as she poked around in the bushes lining the wall with her staff until she found the hole in the wall leading to Hu Maoxun's courtyard. She got down on her knees with far more ease than the last time she'd been there and entered the hole, pushing aside the board covering it to reveal the same sight of the dingy buildings and weed infested garden.

"Hello?" Jiaojiao called warily. "Miss Hu?"

A white robed figure came into view, visibly frowning. "B-bai X-xingyue!"

"It's me."

"You've been g-gone f-for d-days!" she whispered. "T-the es-estate's been in a-an u-uproar! Y-your f-father i-is v-very an-angry!"

"Oh."

"B-bai Xingw-wu has b-been sp-spreading ru-rumors about y-you! Sh-she says y-you," Hu Maoxun shaded her mouth with her sleeve. "That you r-ran o-off with a m-man!"

"Well, she's not wrong," Jiaojiao said, leaving Hu Maoxun agog.

"W-what?"

"What else has happened?"

"N-nothing. I l-let that servant go wh-when y-you didn't c-come back for a wh-whole day," Hu Maoxun blinked lip quivering. "I-I'm s-sorry, sh-she is the o-one who m-made an uproar ab-about your ab-absence."

"Well, you couldn't very well have just left her there. Don't feel bad."

"You g-got y-your l-leg fixed. Th-that's good. J-just. Don't l-let your f-father b-break it a-again. What are y-you going t-to do?"

Jiaojiao held her chin in thought. "I haven't done anything wrong, but I have a feeling that excuse won't fly with dear old dad."

"H-he is f-furious."

"Well, I'd better face it head on. If it really comes to it, I can just run away again."

"D-did you r-really, r-run away with a m-m-m-man?" Hu Maoxun twisted her sleeves.

"Tsk. Why is it that it has to be a man? What if it was a woman?" Jiaojiao mused. 

Hu Maoxun's face was full of question marks.

"Nevermind. You poor sheltered thing. Anyway, countermeasures." Jiaojiao held her chin. *Guang Qiu do you have any ideas? I came back here to get away from Mo Wudi, but it seems doesn't seem like this place is much safer. A father that has broken his daughter's leg once is likely to do it again.*

Bai Xingyue's crippled leg was simply one in a series of unfortunate events that had happened to her. The author hadn't gone into detail regarding the incident, only describing the event as *"Bai Xingyue injured her older brother, causing Bai Qinghan to break her leg in anger."*

But what injury could a ten year old girl possibly inflict on her brother then eighteen year old brother? Why devote several thousand words describing Mo Wudi's various attributes and less than two hundred words in total describing Bai Xingyue's past? The book was riddled with holes, and she could only lament she had no way of leaving bad reviews after transmigrating. Though that brought up the question, was the author also from the Earth she knew? Or some other alternate Earth?

*I cannot help you,* Guang Qiu admitted. *You are on your own.*

*Useless.* Jiaojiao shook her head. "For starters, I cannot let anyone know my leg is healed. It would simply cause more problems."

"T-then?"

Jiaojiao sighed and looked up at the sky. "I didn't want to have to resort to this, but it looks like I have no choice."

Hu Maoxun stared, aghast as Jiaojiao leaned her staff against the wall, then lay down on the dusty ground before rolling back and forth. She scraped up a handful of soft dirt and spread it over her face, peppering her cheeks and neck with filth.

"You mind me borrowing a mirror?"

"Y-yes!" Hu Maoxun scurried away, and returned shortly with a small bronze mirror.

Jiaojiao artfully covered her self with dirt and grime, pulling strands of hair out of her neat braid until she looked completely wretched. She studied her reflection a bit more, then pulled cotton cord from her hair entirely before creating an exquisite rat's nest by bunching her hair and back-combing it with a borrowed comb from Hu Maoxun and some sticky gel created from some boiled tree essence.  

"Perfect."

"Y-you l-look t-terrible."

"Good." Jiaojiao dusted off her hands then picked up her staff. "Thanks for the help. Oh, before I forget."

She fished the correct number of silvers from her sleeve and padded the amount with a bit more before plopping the money into a very confused Hu Maoxun's hands. Jiaojiao sent herself off through the hole in the wall with a careless salute, leaving the baffled and stuttering concubine standing there with her hands full of silver. Ah, it felt good to repay ones debts.

*What do you intend to do now?* Guang Qiu asked. *Will styling yourself a beggar be helpful?*

*You'll see.*

Jiaojiao traveled along the road, turning the corner where Tu Wenfeng had dropped her off, and continuing along the main road, following the long, long wall until she located the main entrance of the Bai estate.  By her estimate, it was close to two or three kilometers. Why was this damn place so big?

It was an austerely decorated set of double doors, complete with Fu dogs, along with a set of stiff-faced doormen in white robes and armor emblazoned with the Bai family standard. 

Jiaojiao took in a deep breath, looked up at the sky. Tears budding in her eyes, she mustered a fraught expression, as if the world had abandoned her, then edged closer to the door. The two guards regarded her warily, raising their spears to point at her.

"Is this beggar crazy? What is she doing blocking the gate?"

"Just drive her away, don't kill her. Don't dirty the entrance with her blood."

*Wow.* Jiaojiao suppressed the urge to roll her eyes. "Don't you recognize me!?" she cried, loud enough for the passersby to frown and turn their heads. "I'm Bai Xingyue! The second young miss of the Bai family!"

The two guards stiffened as Jiaojiao took off the straw hat on her head, displaying her red marked face under the stark afternoon sun. One guard whispered to his partner, then darted inside the gates, no doubt to report to someone.

"Don't you recognize your own master?" Jiaojiao shouted. The passersby murmured and pointed at her face, whispering among themselves.

"You..." the remaining guard said, looking very uncertain at the attention.

"She's so dirty!" a woman laughed. "What happened to her?"

"My servant pawned one of my mother's mementos! I went out to get it back but got lost!" Jiaojiao cried. "I couldn't find the way back with my bad leg and spent the last few nights at a poor temple! But now these guards won't let me back in my own home!"

"She looks so miserable."

"What is the Bai family thinking, letting their own second miss be bullied by her own servant?"

"Why haven't I heard anything about the Bai family miss going missing?"

"Are you an idiot? Is this something to be advertised? A young unmarried woman wandering the capital streets? What would that do to her reputation? Heh!"

"Would a man even want her? Just look at that face...."

"I just don't understand why the marriage agreement hasn't been annulled... she is obviously not suitable... what is the Empress thinking?"

"Hush! Do you want to lose your head? Is the Empress someone you can mention casually?"

"How do you know this is the Bai family miss? What if this is some random beggar?"

"Even if it's just the capital waste, it would be too audacious for a beggar to to blacken the family name unless they had a death wish!"

Jiaojiao began to cry even more miserably, her tears drawing stark trails through the dirt on her face. "My mother's bracelet was pawned by my servant, but I didn't have enough money to buy it back! My allowance was embezzled by her too! All five silvers every month disappears into her purse." Jiaojiao wept and wiped her face with a skinny forearm, revealing her sharp elbows, each bone in the joint distinct with malnutrition.

"Five silvers?"

"Heh! The Bai family really knows how to treat their daughters," someone sneered. "I saw Bai Juan just the other day in Golden Peony the other day. She spent five hundred silvers on one dish alone!"

"Hiss! The gap is so big?"

"One is a genius and the other is a waste. Such a thing is to be expected."

"But this is too much! Look how thin she is."

A cold humph sounded from the gate as it was thrown open. A man with a stern jaw flicked his sleeve at Jiaojiao, anger evident in the set of his jaw and his clenched hands.

"Come inside," he said, teeth clenched. "You still have the face to make a scene at the doors?"

*Enter Bai Qinghan.* Jiaojiao smirked secretly, outwardly she blinked her dewy eyes, face glistening with tears.

"F-father d-don't be an-angry," she whimpered lurching forward with an exaggerated limp. "I just d-didn't w-want m-mother's br-bracelet to be lost."

"She is quite filial." someone muttered. "Even with her leg crippled she still limped through the capital to find her mothers' bracelet?"

"I-I d-don't m-mind e-even if y-you b-break m-my leg again!" Jiaojiao cried. "Just h-help m-me get mother's b-bracelet b-back!"

If Bai Qinghan's face was thunderous before, it was now downright apocalytic. 

*Mortal, are you trying to get yourself killed?* Guang Qiu said.

*Heh, just get it all out.* Jiaojiao smirked secretly. *Let's see him try to hurt me now.*
