Bai Xingyun jolted under her gaze, averting his eyes. His shoulders hunched, and his hands fiddled with each other as if seeking comfort and companionship. "I... what are you talking about? I just wanted to give you some food," he muttered, looking anywhere but at Jiaojiao.

What, was this guy going down the list of guilty body language ticks, *100 Signs Your Partner is Cheating on You*?

Jiaojiao observed the boy across from her in interest, chin resting on her hands. She wasn't hungry for once, and now she had the time and inclination to tease an amusing target.

"What? Is the question so hard to answer?"

"I--I--"

"Is Concubine Hu's stutter contagious? Spit it out."

"I'm sorry I d-don't--"

"Why are you so close with Concubine Hu anyway? Don't tell me you're digging in father's vegetable garden?"

"What?! No!" The boy drew back, aghast. "How could you say such things?"

"Is it normal for a boy to be so close to his father's concubines?"

"I'm merely..." the boys cheeks flooded with an indignant red. "I don't have such thoughts at all!"

"Would it be strange if you did? After all, Concubine Hu is very beautiful, and there's no pesky blood relation."

"Please don't speak any more of this nonsense," the boy said, a thread of anger in his voice. "You can get one or both of us killed if someone overhears."

"Fine, fine. You ancients are seriously uptight."

"I understand you may be suspicious, but I merely wanted to give you a meal," the boy said, his lips quirked mirthlessly. "After all, I know how difficult it can be to live in the Bai estate when father doesn't want to acknowledge you."

"Oh? Are you having daddy troubles?" Jiaojiao's lips quirked in a similar fashion. "It seems everyone in this damn book has daddy issues."

The boy blinked. "What are you talking about?"

"Never mind. Anyway, don't think I don't see you deflecting, kid."

"Kid?"

"Are you going to tell me why you're really here, or are you going to get out?"

The boy's lip jutted out. "You haven't even thanked me for the meal. And aren't you going to thank me for saving your life this morning?"

An acute wave of irritation overcame Jiaojiao. She grit her teeth against the impulse to lash out. "Thank you. Now get out."

The boys eyes flashed, and for a second, Jiaojiao a thread of some indistinct emotion made Jiaojiao uneasy, but it was soon replaced with a distinct look of wry resignation.

"Why do you assume the worst of people?"

"Have you seen my life? Will you please leave?"

"What if I insist on staying?"

Jiaojiao's hand went to the table leg resting by her knee. "Then I guess we can have another kind of conversation."

The boy slumped, then quietly stood. He bowed and excused himself with the proper etiquette, not a stray hair out of place, then disappeared past the broken doorway.

"Weird guy."

Jiaojiao felt a wave of fatigue crash over her like a gentle wave. Her head had been persistently pounding away all the while. She imagined the shambling specter of Bai Xingyue, poised with a sledge hammer, rapping away at the walls of her sanity.

She found herself worrying her lip with her fingers and wrenched her hand away from her mouth. When had she started doing that?

Jiaojiao did not have the habit of mangling her lips. She had deliberately cultivated a habit of not touching her face. What would she do if she smudged her make-up? She could expect her meme-ified self be mocked in all corners of the internet if she looked less than perfect. She wouldn't do anything that would ruin her lip gloss. 

Jiaojiao wasn't an idiot. She knotted her brows, her unbraided hair falling forward hide her face. Was this just what she had to look forward to? The slow erosion of the self from within?

And why was she so hostile toward that kid? She didn't even know the boy that well. While she was suspicious of his motives, he hadn't done anything to harm her, and had in fact helped her more than once.

The morning, he had saved her life, right?

Or did she have *destiny* to thank for that?

Was she turning into Bai Xingyue?

She was tired, and too confused to examine her own mind further.

"I'm going back to bed," Jiaojiao announced.

*You just woke up,* the ball said. *We have so much to do! This is no time to be lazy.*

"I have a *terrible* headache, no doubt courtesy of a certain idiot ball. You're lucky I'm still talking to you at all. How about you try transplanting someone else's life memories into your head and see if you feel like playing nice afterward."

Kicking aside the tea table in a fit of anger, Jiaojiao stalked into the inner chamber, slamming the door so hard it fell straight off its precarious hinges and crashed into the floor, setting off a plume of dust.

Guang Qiu hovered motionlessly over the sleeping mortal, scanning her form for abnormalities. It found nothing out of the ordinary and snuck closer to her head, sending more waves of spiritual probes. It was like throwing pebbles into the sea, they all sunk into her form without returning any relevant information.

It was like that white palace had been a delusion. A figment.

*Nothing.* It thought to itself. *So where is this enormous spiritual world of hers? I cannot sense it at all from her body. More importantly, where does it come from?*

It was stumped. By all logic, being from a backward plane with no spirit energy would exclude the mortal from all sorts of opportunities, and that included the ability to cultivate a spiritual world comprehensive enough to rival someone in the *yuanying* stage.

*Still a martial cripple however,* Guang Qiu lamented to itself. Otherwise its job might have some hope of completion. The things Bai Jing encountered in the book weren't things that the mortal currently had the ability to survive, even if she was *slightly* more able than originally assessed.

Afterall, a rich mind palace would have no bearing on a fight, unless the mortal cultivated some mental techniques--

The ball froze. Was the mortal right? Was it an idiot after all?

Of course not! See, hadn't it found a solution to their problem already? If the mortal couldn't fight with her body then she could--

A sudden shadow appeared at the bedroom window. Guang Qiu grew alert.

*Mortal! Mortal! There's someone at the window!

The mortal didn't stir. How lazy was this girl?

*Mortal! Enemy attack!* Guang Qiu screeched as loudly as he could into the girl's mind.

But there was no reaction other than a slight twitch of her brows.

Guang Qiu panicked. What was wrong? Had he broken the disobedient thing's brain when it transplanted--

The window slid open slowly, revealing their earlier visitor, Bai Xingyun.

What did he want? Guang Qiu wondered.

The boy leapt into the room gracefully, landing as quietly as a sneaking cat. He glided closer to the mortal, and stood ominously over her neither speaking nor acting.

*Mortal! Wake up! You're about to be murdered!!* Guang Qiu shrieked. It considered sending a minute bolt of psychic energy into her head. It might wake her up, or it might give her a concussion, but it was out of options--

"Don't you dare," the boy suddenly said. His eyes rested precisely on Guang Qiu's form.

Guang Qiu's light shot up in lumens. *You can see me?!*

"I'm here to speak to you."

*What?! What is happening? Who are you? Did the bureau send you??* Guang Qiu paused then it's light began to strobe in agitation. *Am I being assessed? What nerve! I am one of the top employees of the upper echelon! How dare they send an agent to edge in on my miss--*

"Shut up," the boy said. "I'm not here to disturb your mission. In fact, I'm here to help."

If anything, the ball grew more luminous. *I do* NOT *need help!*

"Your mission target has disappeared and been replaced with with a random placeholder," the boy said with a smirk. "You still think you're beyond reproach?"

*I-- that was beyond my control!*

"I understand, which is why I'm here to help." the boy's eyes drifted to the golden wood bracelet on the mortal's wrist. "It seems the artifact is damaged as well?"

*That...* the ball drifted off. Emotions of embarrassment wafted off it.

"I have a solution, give her a comparable replacement."

*What? Isn't that... against the rules?*

"Do you have a choice?" the boy shook his head, the white bone hairpin glowed in the gloomy light. "If this goes on, she'll be murdered before long. You know what comes next."

The ball shook. *You have a copy of the manifest as well? They gave you a copy?*

"Don't be so sullen, can you blame them for worrying given the current cirucmstances?"

The ball didn't respond, but its light grew several fractions more sullen.

*What replacement would be appropriate?* It asked at last.

"I have a mustard seed space," the boy said, holding out his hand. An innocuous black speck lay on his palm. "You can give it to her when she wakes up."

*What?! Something so valuable!*

"It's not much," the boy responded with a sniff.

The emotions coming off the ball smelt now of envy. It flew closer and with a pop of light, the speck disappeared from the boy's palm.

*Is this all you came to tell me?* The ball asked, a fraction more friendly.

"I have some suggestions," the boy said, smile growing a bit still. "Did you do something to the... mortal?"

*Something? What do you mean?*

"She was behaving much differently yesterday. Less, suicidal for one."

*Ah. She was not behaving herself, deviating from the plot everywhere she could. So I placed the original host's memories--*

There was a crack of distressed wood. Guang Qiu looked over to see a long snaking line in the floor of the room where the floorboards had split open. The boy was glaring at the ball, tumultuous energy spiking off of his form.

"You did what?"

*I--*

"Listen closely. I don't know what stupid thoughts were running through your head when you compromised the sanity of your host, but I advise you to abandon them now."

*What's the problem?* Guang Qiu asked, flabbergasted. *Are you... angry with me?*

"I've never seen such carelessness in an agent before, should I be delighted instead? What if you'd gone and made her a vegetable or driven her directly insane? Could the mission still be completed then?"

The ball shrunk in on itself in embarrassment. *But she just wouldn't listen!*

The boy held his forehead between his thumb and middle finger, massaging. "Idiot. Don't you have a service record of five hundred years? How did you operate until now?"

*My hosts until this one were very amenable! I just don't know what is this ones problem! She has no motivation at all! No thirst for power! She just wants to--to-- cause problems for me!*

"Idiot, haven't you asked her what she wanted? I highly doubt her true motivation is to cause problems for you?"

*Of course I asked her! But she's asking for the impossible! You know resurrecting the dead is against the tenets!*

The boy froze with his hands on either sides of his temples, mid-massage, eyes wide. "She asked for what?"

*She said she has people she wants to resurrect! And it's the only thing she wants.*

The boy held his face. "That is indeed a problem."

*You agree then!*

The boy frowned, staring at the sleeping girl. "What would you do to fulfill that wish? How far would you go?"

*What?*

"I've become acquainted with her over the past day, and I can say with certainty that she is open to persuasion, but not coercion. The more you try to control her, the more she will go out of her way to defy you."

*Then..?*

"Surely you can lower yourself and converse with her like a gentleman? Why do you rush to deny her wishes? If she wants to resurrect people, it's not entirely impossible."

*What?! You must be insane!*

"It's against the rules for the bureau to perform such actions but..." he glanced down at the girl. "The same rules don't apply to her."

*You mean...?*

"Tempt her with the promise of power. With power, anything is possible, even raising the dead."

*But what about--*

"I've stayed too long. She should be waking up soon," the boy leapt to the window sill, then looked over his shoulder. "It should be obvious that speaking of this conversation is strictly prohibited."

*I'm not an idiot!* snarled Guang Qiu, but the boy was already gone.

"Could have fooled me," came a faint voice on the wind.
