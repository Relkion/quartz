Jiaojiao, sweaty, irritated, and very unhappy, arrived at a deserted road half a mile from the outer wall of the Bai Estate. She cursed the Bai Family ancestors for choosing to establish their compound so far from a main road. There was no one in sight and she was already tired, her right leg a dead, agonized weight attached to her hip. Even Guang Qiu had fallen silent, content to watch her suffer. Or perhaps it had the decency to keeps its mouth shut.

"That's it, I can't go on," Jiaojiao announced, abruptly sitting down at the side of the road, uncaring of the dust and gravel underfoot.

*You must,* Guang Qiu roared. *What of the artifact? Every second we delay some idiot mortal swoop in and take it!*

"Why are you so worried?" Jiaojiao wiped the sweat from her neck with a sleeve, then held it at arms length, disgusted with her own actions, disgusted with the world in general. "It's not as if anyone knows it's true value. It's just a wooden bracelet to all eyes but yours."

*We cannot take the risk. If it slips through our grasp, what then?*

"Then I guess the universe doesn't want us to have the bracelet," Jiaojiao tapped her lap impatiently. "What do you want me to do? I can't even move this leg right now."

As if on cue, a teenaged boy pulling a rickshaw behind him clattered around the bend in the road, head down as sweat streamed down his face. He was dressed in worn hemp clothes, even rougher than the ones Jiaojiao was wearing. She watched as the boy drew nearer and nearer, expelling a put upon sigh. Must she be forced to move?

"Wait," she called as the boy drew within earshot. "I want to hire you!"

The boy jerked his face up, surprised to see a person half-lying by the side of the road, no doubt. Face unsure, he stopped next to Jiaojiao. "Where are you going?"

"Do you know where I can find a reputable doctor?"

*Mortal!* Guang Qiu shrieked in her mind.

"I can take you to one," the boy said.

"How much?"

The boy scanned Jiaojiao's form with a critical eye, taking in her altered servant's robes, dusty and damp with sweat, her straw hat, old and splintered. Her spirit over-taxed and woe-begone.

"Five coppers."

Jiaojiao wasn't an idiot. She could tell the boy had bumped up the price, but she was too lazy to argue and she was *tired*.

"Fine, fine," she stood with effort and fished a few copper coins from her sleeve. "Half now, half upon arrival."

The boy grunted by way of agreement and pulled the cart back onto the road when Jiaojiao had seated herself. With a hop he took off running, his speed little affected by Jiaojiao's addition weight. Jiaojiao had no choice to be impressed by his physical fitness.

*Mortal, what are you doing? Didn't we agree we would retrieve the artifact first?*

*When did we reach this fictatious agreement?* Jiaojiao closed her eyes. The morning breeze wicking the sweat from her brow felt *heavenly*.

Guang Qiu sputtered. *You--you--*

*You know, Guang Qiu, I've only been in this world for a day, but I've had a lot of time to think about why I'm here.*

*You will listen to me--*

Jiaojiao inspected her ragged nails. *I've come to a conclusion. Despite all your threats, I don't think you can do a thing to me.

*Don't be so sure, mortal--*

Jiaojiao smiled to herself. She didn't have all the answers, but she had enough. From the scraps of information Guang Qiu dropped, she could ascertain that she possessed something that led Guang Qiu to choose her out of all of the dead souls on earth. If she was so easily replaced, she didn't doubt Guang Qiu would have switched her with the first gullible rando he could find. After all, why bother fishing back a soul from earth at all? Wouldn't it make more sense to grab a local that was familiar with this world? After all, it was painfully evident, *she* didn't know what the hell she was doing. She couldn't even feed herself!

Furthermore, if what if it was specifically a soul from earth that was needed? Going by what Guang Qiu said, she had a long long time before the passage between worlds opened again and they found a replacement for her. What could happen in one thousand years? Two thousand years? Assuming she even lived that long. 

Jiaojiao didn't care much for the idea of immortality. Especially immortality in a world with none of the modern necessities she so craved.

"Things are precious because they have an end," she sighed.

"What?" the boy panted from the head of rickshaw. "Did you say something?"

"It's nothing," Jiaojiao replied, shaking her head. She took another admiring glance at the boy, huffing and puffing under weight of the rickshaw.

*Why couldn't you have gotten me a body like his?* she asked Guang Qiu, who had gone as quiet as a strangled chicken. She immediately regretted engaging it as this seemed to light a fire under its metaphorical ass.

*You dare speak to me thus?*  it thundered in her ear, buzzing and humming like an irate cellphone. *You will show me respect! If it were not for me, you would be dead! You should be grateful you have a body at all! I--*

*Yes, yes, yes,* Jiaojiao interrupted. *You've made your point. Don't worry, the moment I finish seeing the doctor, I will go to Yixin street.*

*Hah! Fool me once! As if I will believe your lies!*

*Actually, I never lied.*

*I will believe you if you make a vow!*

*Why should I care if you believe me or not?*

*I--I--*

Jiaojiao smiled.

*I won't let you rest if you don't! Guang Qiu said triumphantly. *I will nag and nag until you do!*

Jiaojiao's face fell. 

*Hah, that will teach you to defy me-- see if I let you rest at all, if you don't listen to me. Just watch me! I don't need to rest, I can go all night! I will scream in your ear until dawn--*

Jiaojiao pinched the bridge of your nose. *That... sounds so wrong. Please stop.*

*Well, mortal?*

There was a very good reason Jiaojiao was hesitant to make vows. In this blasted world she'd landed in, a person's vows had a real binding effect. Even if she was still a skeptic where magic was concerned, she didn't want to take the risk.

*I vow to go to Yixin street after I see the doctor,*  Jiaojiao said finally with a scoff. *Happy?*

*I would be* happy *if Bai Jing--*

*My god, you little fan boy, just stop!*

Jiaojiao's enjoyment of the scenery was almost ruined by Guang Qiu's ongoing argument, but inner voice cut off as the rickshaw turned down a busy street. 

The orderly streets spread open in front of her, hammering in the point that she was really in another world. Or at least, a very expensive movie set. She took in the bustling forms, the farmers hawking their wares, the armored guards standing on the corners of each street, the skeins of silk hanging in neat bunches outside of a dye shop. Chaotic voices called to one another through the crowds. A young child darted underfoot, a rattle drum grasped in one hand, their mother yelling after them to watch out for the carts.

"We're here," the boy said, lowering the poles with a grunt. "It's that shop over there."

Jiaojiao placed the other half of the payment in his outstretched hand. "If you have time, I have another job for you later, after I see the doctor."

He took the money and nodded, seemingly not much for words.

Jiaojiao hopped off the rickshaw, subtly patting her numb ass. The ancient roads left something to be desired and it wasn't as if the primitive rickshaw had shock absorbers. 

She let herself through the open doors of the clinic, wrinkling her nose as the pungent smell of herbs assaulted her senses. She could practically taste the gingko on her tongue.

The shop was well-kept, with clean floors and counters, but there there was a noticeable stillness. The waiting area was empty and many of the drawers on the wall had been pulled out and stacked on the counter. A glance revealed nothing inside. Furthermore, there was no one in sight. 

Jiaojiao hefted her staff and rapped the counter. "Hello?"

A middle-aged man with a short beard and impatient frown stalked into view, his white robes cutting a stark figure. "Don't scratch my counters, girl!"

*Okay then.* Jiaojiao lowered her staff. "I'm here for a consultation."

The man raked a scathing glance over her dusty body. "Do you have money?"

"I have money."

The man held out his hand with a flourish of his long, flowing sleeves. "Fifty silver ingots."

Jiaojiao stared at it. Did this man take her for a simpleton? Even if fifty silver ingots was a reasonable price, she didn't have fifty silver ingots to feed this gluttonous troll.

"Well?" the man gestured impatiently. "I don't have all day."

Jiaojiao smiled. "That's funny. Neither do I."

"Did you come in here to play games? Give me the money or get out."

"Are you a beggar?"

"What?"

Jiaojiao's smile grew brighter. "I said, are you a beggar?"

"Outrageous!" the man barked, his fist raised. "How dare you? I am a doctor!"

"Then act like one. All I see is a greedy old man eager to part a young girl from her money." 

"You asked for a consultation, I don't run a charity."

"Do you see my youth, and perhaps think I am easy to cheat? I'll pay you after, not before."

"I will not tolerate this disrespect!"

"Do you even have the skills?" Jiaojiao took a pointed glance at the deserted waiting area.

The frown turned into one of wrath. "You dare question my skills?"

"I'm only returning rudeness for rudeness," Jiaojiao said.

"I am a doctor!" the man said again.

Jiaojiao shook her head and turned to leave. 

"Wait!"

Jiaojiao didn't stop.

A hand closed over her shoulder. She turned to glare at the man. "Don't touch me."

"I will take a look at your leg," the man forced out through gritted teeth. "That is why you are here, yes?"

"I see you aren't blind.""

The man audibly ground his teeth. "Just promise you'll pay me afterward."

"We'll see."

The man withdrew his hand, gesturing for Jiaojiao to follow him to the back with an irritated jerk of his arm .

*Why did he change his mind?* Guang Qiu said.

*He badly needs money. You can see how run down this place is. There's no customers, and half the shelves are empty. My guess is he's about to close down. In other words he's very near desperation.*

*Wait...*

*Yes, if my guess is correct,* Jiaojiao's face turned solemn. *This man is Doctor Tai.*
