Jiaojiao's heart felt like it would beat itself into an early retirement. Cold sweat beaded on her brow as the boy across from her froze, considering her words. She felt even more apprehensive than she had earlier, in the path of a galloping horse cart. This boy, Mo Wudi was just like a random field boss, who knew when he'd pop out to ruin her day. Except, there probably wasn't a second reset for her if she died.

Did she fear death? She had a hard time finding an answer for herself. But if she was being honest, she was quite, *reluctant.*

"A deal?"

"We can help each other."

"I don't need help," came the immediate, unswerving response.

Jiaojiao wanted to roll her eyes. "Why are men always like this? Are you losing something if you admit you might benefit from a partnership?"

"What could you possibly offer me."

"I have the ability to make a lot of money."

"I have money."

"Enough to start a war?"

Suddenly the sword was against her throat. There was no pain, but a droplet of warm blood ran down the length of the blade before coming to rest on the guard, as if it had been rushing to go home. It was *sharp.*

"I see Duan Zhuo knows his blades," Jiaojiao muttered.

"What do you know about war?" The boy asked.

"Next to nothing," Jiaojiao admitted. "But I know you want to start one."

"Who told you this?"

"I can tell you," Jiaojiao said slyly, pettily, ignoring the angry flashing and humming of the ball hovering in her peripheral vision, "but you have to put down the sword and have a conversation with me where I don't have to worry about the constant threat of death."

"What if you lie?"

"I can make a vow. You people take those seriously, right?"

The boy was silent, chewing her words over in his head. "I can let you speak, but you insulted my mother yesterday. I can't let you go."

Jiaojiao smiled awkwardly. "You would kill over some words spoken in anger? Wait, never mind, what am I saying? Of course you would."

"The mouth is the origin of disaster."

"I'm beginning to realize that."

The boy sheathed his sword with a flash of cold light, and soon sat in repose on at the tea table, movements like a haiku. "I will listen to you for now. But I can't promise I won't kill you."

Jiaojiao took rummaged in one of the dusty cupboards, and unearthed a stubby candle, only about two centimeters tall. Locating the fire piston, she lit the wick and placed in on the table between them.

"I vow for as long as this candle continues to burn, I will speak the truth."

Jiaojiao shook, feeling an undefined something wrapping itself around her. She shivered, uneasy. Despite having witnessed some strange things as of late, she still had trouble accepting the existence of magic and spirit energy. Now she'd gone and stuck her foot in it herself. She cast a paranoid glance at the ceiling, feeling as if some enormous eye in the sky had glanced at her for the slightest of moments.

She shook off the strange feeling, watching as the newly lit flame cast a sheen of light on the curves of the boy's porcelain mask. She wanted to ask him to remove it, because it was bugging the crap out of her not being able to gauge his expression, but if she were honest with herself, she just wanted to get another look at his face. 

Look, she wasn't blind, okay? The boy was pretty.

Jiaojiao breathe out. "I'm not Bai Xingyue, as you've guessed. In fact, I'm not even from this world."

Near the ceiling, the ball was having an apoplectic fit. *Mortal! Do you know what danger you're putting yourself in?!*

If the boy felt shocked at her confession, he didn't show it. "Explain."

Jiaojiao briefly touched on her origins, and the exact nature of how she'd ended up in Bai Xingyue's body.

"In fact, it's not a complicated story. I died and instead of doing whatever dead souls do, like reincarnate, I was put here by a--" Jiaojiao gagged.

The empty eyes of the mask stared.

Jiaojiao coughed. "As I was saying, I was put here by a spppp--"

"Are you unwell?" the boy asked impatiently.

"Wait a second, I seem to have come across some technical problems," Jiaojiao laughed angrily and turned to the ball floating smugly in the corner. "More of your tricks?"

*I warned you not to cross me!*

Jiaojiao slammed a fist on the table and pointed at the ball. "You know what? It doesn't matter! Because I know jackshit about you anyway!"

She turned to Mo Wudi. "Basically, I was placed here against my will, okay? By what exactly, I don't know. For a purpose I don't agree with, but I can tell you right now, I don't mean you any harm. So, can you just *relax*? Because the death threats are seriously getting old."

The boy was leaning slightly away from Jiaojiao, looking between her and the empty corner she was gesturing towards. He seemed to be internally debating whether Jiaojiao, was in fact, mad.

"I have heard of a case of a man," Mo Wudi spoke slowly. "A *shu* son of the Mu family, who seemed to have two souls living in his body."

Jiaojiao felt her face. "Well, normally I'd argue to the contrary, but hehe."

"One of his souls would act with extreme perversion, while the other would apologize for the first soul's behavior."

"Extreme perversion?" Jiaojiao asked curiously. "How extreme are we talking?"

"He would routinely order his servants under threat of death to strip naked and dance wildly in front of his grandmoth--"

"Alright, I'm going to stop you right there--" Jiaojiao held up a hand. "Yeah, I don't think you have to worry about that with me."

"What about--"

"Hey, we seem to have gone *way* off topic. How about we talk about our deal, huh?"

The boy's head tilted, giving the mask a slightly naiive, questioning air. "Very well. What deal are you proposing?"

*Careful.* "I can make you a lot of money. Dian Zhuo has shown you the blueprints I drew? What if I told you those were the simplest of the plans I can provide?"

A loaded pause. For a second, Jiaojiao was afraid he would ask something *dangerous* like, *"what makes you believe I need money?"* but instead, he said, "What else?"

"I can show you how to make machines capable of forever changing the textile industry in this backward ass--cough--I mean, this world. For instance, a loom that can produce many yards--er--*chi* of cloth within an hour. Or a spinning machine that can create cotton or hemp thread a thousand times the speed a human is capable of."

Mo Wudi cocked his head. "I have heard of an all female sect in the southern forests that specialize in weaving and spinning. Only they are capable of such feats."

"Oh? Interesting," Jiaojiao leaned forward. "What do their products look like? Do they produce clothes or are they specialized in linens? Are they also skilled in dying? What colors--"

*Mortal, focus! You have his attention!*

Jiaojjiao coughed, sneaking a glance at the flickering candle. "Anyway, my machines can be operated by people with no cultivation."

Mo Wudi's mask also turned toward the candle. "If you truly aren't lying, then perhaps you can be of use to me."

*Could you be more patronizing?* Jiaojiao wanted to kill something. *God, I'm being talked down to by a highschooler that probably hasn't even grown in all his pubes.*

But one had to bow ones head under the eaves.

The boy's hand went to his sword hilt, but it seemed more a movement of one deep in thought than a threatening gesture. "If you are not Bai Xingyue, then who are you?"

"You can call me Jiaojiao."

"Jiaolong?"

"Why is that always the first question? No, not jiaolong, it's *jiao*." She wrote the character in the air.

"Have you considered the possibility that this is all a delusion?" The boy asked. "Perhaps you truly believe to be a soul from a foreign world, but in fact, you are merely a girl who has been driven mad by her environment?" the mask turned towards the surroundings, full of drab, broken things and sad memories. "That son of the Mu family, would be your maternal uncle." Mo Wudi paused. "I've heard that some diseases of the mind can be passed through the blood--"

"That's not what's happening here, okay?" Jiaojiao said between gritted teeth.

The mask, though fixed in a permanent demonic scowl, seemed to radiate doubt.

"You think a girl, sequestered in her courtyard all her life is capable of producing those blueprints? Where would she get the training or even the ideas?"

"Geniuses have sprung from more unlikely backgrounds."

"Thanks for the compliment, but not this particular genius. Anyway," Jiaojiao glanced at the candle, the last of the wick about to gutter out. "Your time is almost up. You should ask your questions quickly."

The mask titled the barest of angles. "What do you want?"

"Excuse me?"

"Surely there is something you want in this exchange."

Jiaojiao smiled. Finally they were getting to the point! "I need protection. It should be obvious why. My--or rather Bai Xingyue's stepmother, stepsisters, the Empress, and probably a few other randos, want me dead."

"What do you intend to do?"

"What? Besides live my life? Who the hell knows?"

"I should clarify. Do you still intend to marry the crown prince and become the mother of the country?"

*Step carefully mortal!* Guang Qiu warned.

*You don't have to tell me.* Jiaojiao smiled mockingly. "Are you afraid of me joining forces with the crown prince? Is that why you're so eager to kill me? You think I'd be on his side, because I'm his supposed fiance? Who doesn't know that the crown prince and the crippled thirteenth prince are like fire and water. Tsk, tsk. Even Bai Xingyue who never stepped out of her courtyard knows of your longstanding feud."

The silence was answer in itself.

"I've said before, I'm not Bai Xingyue. That engagement has nothing to do with me. Furthermore, Bai Xingyue herself didn't have much love for the crown prince." Jiaojiao's eyes grew hazy. "She just wanted to be free of this fate. This engagement has brought her nothing but suffering."

Mo Wudi tapped the hilt of his sword with a long, beautifully jointed finger. "And beyond that?"

"Hmm? Trying to dig up all my secrets in one go, I see."

The finger's tapping grew in speed.

"You want to know my deepest desire? Do you think you can use it to control me?" Jiaojiao's mouth quirked a little strangely. "I suppose there's no harm in telling you. There's something else I want, but it's not something you can help me with."

"Why not?"

"Can you raise the dead?"

The candle went out. A thin strand of smoke rose and scattered, leaving a scorched scent.

"I cannot."

"Then there's no point talking about it."

Silence. 

"Do we have a deal?" Jiaojiao hesitantly offered her hand.

Mo Wudi stood, ignoring the outstretched hand poised between them. "I will be in touch."

The next second, the space where he stood was vacant. Only the slight whoosh of displaced air suggested that the entire conversation hadn't taken place in Jiaojiao's confused mind.

Jiaojiao let out a breath she hadn't realized she'd been holding. "That boy is going to give me heart disease," she said, holding her chest.

*This is good progress. At least he doesn't seem to want to kill you anymore.*

"Who knows what's going on in that boy's head? For all we know, he'll come back tonight and lop off my head while I'm sleeping."

He'd done such things in the book after all. Jiaojiao fell back on the *kang*, the abused furniture giving a plaintive groan. No matter. Just field each crisis as it comes.
