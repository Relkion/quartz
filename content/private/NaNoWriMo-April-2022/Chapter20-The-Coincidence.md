"Give me back my blueprints," Jiaojiao said throwing the bag of gold in Dian Zhuo's face. He caught it an inch from his nose. "The deal it off."

"Money has already exchanged hands," Dian Zhuo protested.

Jiaojiao thrust out her hand. "The blueprint!"

Dian Zhuo smirked and threw back the bag of gold. "I refuse."

Jiaojiao caught the bag with difficulty, wrist aching from the strength of the toss.

"If you throw that bag again, I will keep it *and* the blueprints," Dian Zhuo warned, pointing a finger at Jiaojiao. "Just behave and wait for me to have conversation with this gentleman."

*Behave? What am I, a child?*

*You have not undergone your hair-pinning ceremony, so you are still a girl,* Guang Qiu said.

*I'm already twenty-three. I am am grown-ass woman, okay? Get it straight. The body may be young but the mind hasn't regressed, okay?*

"Master, why have you come?" Dian Zhuo asked.

Mo Wudi untied the sword from his waist and presented it to Dian Zhuo with both hands.

"I see, it has been a while since I last sharpened it," Dian Zhuo said.

Jiaojiao tried to limp away from the two men, but Dian Zhuo easily sidestepped and blocked her way with a single stride. She moved in the other direction, but he followed, a strange quirk to his mouth. "Where do you think you're going?"

"Are you still a human being? Or a dog who doesn't know better?" Jiaojiao said, a very stiff smile on her face. 

"You will speak politely, or not at all!" Dian Zhuo said, clapping his hands together. A teenaged apprenticed darted from the forge area, bowing slightly to Mo Wudi and his master. 

"Take this girl inside and make sure she doesn't go anywhere."

"Yes master," the boy said, reaching sooty, sweaty, and callused hands toward Jiaojiao.

Jiaojiao seldom cursed. At least not out loud. She prided herself on her self-control, and in fact, believed her self-control to be very good. 

In her past life, society came with some guarantees. For example, if you behaved yourself, you could be expected to receive some basic measure of respect, whether it be from your peers, your family, or society. There might be some outliers who would go out of their way to disrespect you, but they were in the minority, and they would in turn receive condemnation for such behavior.

There was so much she didn't understand about this world, other than that she had been brought here for some goddamned mission she wanted no part in. That her old way of life was becoming less and less relevant. That her priceless self control was worthless here.

To hell with it. What was the use of controlling yourself when you could not control others around you. Why behave when you weren't rewarded for it?

"Go fuck your mom," Jiaojiao said to Mo Wudi. 

Mo Wudi grew very very still, like a polar ice cap right before it collapsed into the sea, bringing with it an entire ecosystem. "What?"

"I said, go fuck your mom."

Dian Zhuo was hilariously wide-eyed, mouth hanging open. "Little girl--"

"Why don't you fuck your mom, too? Why don't you all go fuck your moms?" She added to the shocked apprentice, who had paused with his hand in midair, still reaching for her.

"Little girl! The mouth is the mother of disaster," Dian Zhuo warned. "Behave yourself!"

*Behave,* there was that word again. *Behave.*

 "Why are you suddenly so angry? To speak that way to the master--"

"Why am I angry? Is this how you conduct business? Randomly detaining your guests? How unique." Jiaojiao said, applauding sarcastically. "Behave, he says. Why does man never look at himself before lecturing others? The world is full of blustering fools who think the heavens owe them a debt. Behave? Why the hell should I? What the hell is the point?"

"Worse than a marketplace shrew!" Dian Zhuo said. "What has you possessed? This ugly lingering spirit has the daring to insult master's mother. Her tongue should be cut out."

Jiaojiao was accustomed to verbal damnation. She was after all, an internet celebrity in her past life, subject to the criticism of anyone who had access to a keyboard. 

"My tongue should be cut out? Why? Because it says truths you don't want to hear? You think I don't know you were cheating me with that deal? I just didn't care to speak with an uncultured, money-hungry thug any longer. Did you think I didn't notice you trying to dig for more secrets? You think a dull mind is capable of designing that machine? Idiot! Imbecile! Naive."

Dian Zhuo gave an angry growl and reached for Jiaojiao. "You will be silent."

"Fuck your mom. Fuck your sister. Fuck your dad. Fuck your uncle. And most of all, go fuck yourself!" Jiaojiao cursed.

There was a sudden, uproarious crack and a Jiaojiao shut her eyes as a blinding flash of purple light lanced her eyes. The taste of sizzling ozone ran across Jiaojiao's tongue. A rumble of collapsing stone sent a shock of dust and grit pouring over the smithy. 

Jiaojiao coughed, then blinked the tears from her eyes, her scalded retinas aching with white afterimages.

Mo Wudi stood in the trembling silence, arm raised, tip of his hand crackling with residual energy. The entire east wall of the smithy was gone, replaced by a blackened, smoking trail of rubble. 

"Shut up."

Jiaojiao, who rarely ever felt shock, was shocked into a rare silence. She'd known, in theory, that there were magic powers in this world. That physical strength was the lowest common denominator among the truly strong. Spirit energy, the true source of power in this world, was capable of some epic shit. Epic shit that could apparently dust a wall with a flick of a finger, even at the lower ends of the spectrum. Yes, Mo Wudi, in all his wall-breaking glory, was of the mere Qi Condensation stage. A baby immortal.

*Domineering!* Guang Qiu cheered.

"Did you have to break my wall?" Dian Zhuo complained.

Mo Wudi simply lowered his arm and proceeded  to have a long conversation with Dian Zhuo about the repair job on his sword. The apprentice had long made himself scarce in the aftermath of Mo Wudi's outburst. The confused voices in the surroundings indicated that there was chaos out in the streets as people wondered what had happened, but the two men conversing in the courtyard took no heed of it.

Jiaojiao stared at Guang Qiu, lost in thought.

*You knew he would be here.*

*What?* Guang Qiu said.

*You knew this psycho would be here,* she indicated Mo Wudi with the slightest tip of her head. *That's why you've been so quiet.*

*So what if I did?*

*It seems things aren't as simple as I thought. The events of the book, while some details can be changed at will with my actions, the larger plot points have a way of making themselves known.* she paused. *For example, Tu Wenfeng. Doctor Tai. Dian Zhuo and Mo Wudi. What are the chances that I would meet all four of them just randomly walking about a city?*

*Destiny has its own momentum.* Guang Qiu said simply, and with finality.

Jiaojiao chewed on this. What did that mean for her? She gave a sideways look at Mo Wudi. His porcelain demon mask blocked any insight to his present expression. His perfect body posture gave no clues to his present mood, and his voice, while textured like velvet, was entirely monotone.

One of the biggest plot arcs in the book was Bai Jing and Mo Wudi's epic romance, though the first five hundred chapters only covered them beginning a tentative back and forth with some light kissing and hugging, Jiaojiao could read between the lines. They were *destined*.

Did that mean she was doomed to fall in love with this psychotic wall-breaking muscle-head? 

*Hah.*

Jiaojiao waited, her arms and legs growing numb from standing in the same position for too long. It was nearly thirty minutes before Mo Wudi concluded his discussion with Dian Zhuo about the routine repair on his sword. 

The teenager's obsessive tendencies were on full display. Even Dian Zhuo was looking fatigued by the overly detailed conversation that ranged from the number of times the sword needed to be run over the grindstone for sharpening, the angle of the blade on the grindstone, the varying grits to use on the blade and in what order et cetera. Jiaojiao's eyes had long glazed over in boredom. By the time Mo Wudi had concluded his instructions on the rations of various tung oil to used on the blade, even Dian Zhuo couldn't take it anymore and cut his master off with a-- "Ah! It's getting late, lets' continue this discussion inside!" Then hurried indoors with a fleet step, seeming to completely overlook the presence  of Jiaojiao.

Jiaojiao took that oversight to edge toward the exit, but Mo Wudi angled his body towards her, the blackened eyeholes of his mask staring.

He said nothing, but Jiaojiao got the gist. *I'm watching you.*

She reluctantly followed Dian Zhuo indoors under the careful eyes of Mo Wudi, who crept behind her, soundless as a shadow. She envied his easy grace, longing for the days when she too, could move like a dancer. 

*You think you're so hot?* she cursed the boy in her mind. *My past body could have put yours to shame.*

*Unlikely,* Guang Qiu said with a snort. *Mo Wudi has a Heaven Grade Spirit Root of the Thunder Element, and a Yang Physique. Such qualifications are priceless even in the overworld.*

*Overworld?*

Guang Qiu choked. *None of your business.*

Jiaojiao took a note of it. In other words this world was one of a "lower" variety. She shook her head. She only had the first five hundred chapters of the book. While that might seem like a lot, it was only a fraction of a five thousand chapter series. She knew very little about the world of Shaofu.

Mo Wudi, Dian Zhuo and Jiaojiao were soon seated at a dining table, the latter two sipping tea served by a nervous apprentice who nearly emptied a teapot on Mo Wudi with his shaking hands. Dian Zhuo irately dismissed this apprentice and poured tea for his master himself. Jiaojiao, clearly had to pour her own tea. She rolled her eyes, leg pinched with discomfort as she knelt one-legged in order to do so.

"Are you finally done talking about your sword?" Jiaojiao asked with a peeved smile. "Maybe you would like to discuss the number of silk strands needed in the tassels?"

"That is a good point," Mo Wudi agreed.

Jiaojiao nearly slammed her head into the table. 

*Why is he like this? Was this always part of his character setting?* she asked Guang Qiu. *He did came off as a bit stodgy in the books, but this is ridiculous!*

Guang Qiu's light swirled in thought. *Perhaps... Bai Jing inspired him to be less so?*

*Isn't it always her?* Jiaojiao griped. *This golden rainbow Mary Sue special snowflake girl?*

*Is it still a rainbow if it's gold?* Guang Qiu asked.

Mo Wudi concluded another exhausting conversation about silk tassels  in fifteen minutes. This time Jiaojiao did not make another sarcastic aside. Who knew if he would take it seriously?

"Master," Dian Zhuo coughed. "I have a proposition."

"Speak."

"I think we should recruit this girl," he indicated Jiaojiao with a thick finger. "She has brains. We can use her." He showed Mo Wudi the two blueprints Jiaojiao had sold to him. 

Jiaojiao rolled her eyes. "Is anyone going to ask me if I agree? No wait, that would be considerate, I forget I'm in a land of savages." she shook her head and sipped tea.

"The two men looked at her with cold eyes.

"I will speak to her in private," Mo Wudi said.

Dian Zhuo nodded and cupped his hands before leaving with a last, gloating look at Jiaojiao.

Mo Wudi waited for the heavy footsteps to die away before speaking.

"You," Mo Wudi spoke, slowly, ponderously, as if every word was costing him undue processing power. "Are, Bai Xingyue?"

"Oh?" Jiaojiao said, setting  her tea cup down hard enough to chip the bottom. "This is what you wanted to talk to me about? Weren't you very sure? Why is this phrased like a question now?"

"You, are her," Mo Wudi spoke again, haltingly. "But, you also are not her."

*Don't tell him the truth!* Guang Qiu warned, finally realizing the danger.

Jiaojiao smirked. "I'm really not her. How did you know?"

"Because I spoke with her, before she drowned to death in my pond."

Wait. What? *She Ma*? NA-the-fuck-NI?

*What?* Guang Qiu said, then proceeded to make a horrific sound reminiscent of dial-up modems.

Jiaojiao held up a hand. "Wait, hold up. You spoke to Bai Xingyue?"

Mo Wudi's empty eyes seemed to suck in all the light in the room. "I believe I was the last one to see her alive."
