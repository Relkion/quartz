Guang Qiu professed that it didn't have a good understanding of the mortal he'd personally stolen from that minor realm. At the beginning, it had merely been concerned with the vacancy left behind the heroine of his chosen assignment and hadn't considered too much when picking up the nearest replacement with sufficient *ming*. After all, what difference did one mortal have from the next? Surely, the gap wouldn't be *too* big.

Mortals were simple creatures. They lusted for life, for wealth, for power. If he pulled on the right strings, made the right threats, it wouldn't be hard to get the creature to dance the way he needed it to.

At least, that *had* been the plan.

*What... what is this place?* Guang Qiu asked the girl in the middle of the shattered hall.

"You want to know?"

*I--*

"Then I won't tell you."

*MORTAL!!*

The girl patted her ear, careful not to get her long nails tangled with her hair. "Could you keep it down? The echo in here is pretty significant."

*How? Why?*

"I bet you're curious. I bet you're *dying* to know what's going on."

*Well--I--*

"Yeah, I think I like it when you're confused. You're cuter this way." 

The girl kicked aside a half crumbled brick, and strolled down one of the many corridors branching from the cavernous hall. Sunlight, soft and luminous, brushed the tips of her long curled eyelashes as she passed the latticed windows. A sapphire blue bird alighted on the sill of a window before darting away at her approach.

Guang Qiu drifted after Jiaojiao, it's mind blank and fuzzy like cotton. The tall ceilings were three times the height of the girl, dwarfing her figure, and yet she seemed the undisputed master of this mysterious realm. The light seemed to gather on her form like specks of glitter, shrouding her in a gauzy cocoon.

It seemed a minute, it seemed like ten. It also seemed like time had stopped. The form of a girl and the ball wandered through the branching halls, passing half collapsed walls, and empty rooms, full of dust and an indistinct melancholia.

There were many barred stone doorways, some set with cloudy gems, their facets hidden under dust and time. Guang Qiu attempted to enter one of these closed rooms, only to be bounced back by an unseen force. Jiaojiao merely gave it a sarcastic look at this behavior.

Finally, they came to a grand doorway, carved grandly with abstract, curling shapes and unknown glyphs. Jiaojiao placed a hand on the carved white handle. 

"It's been a long time," Jiaojiao said, brushing her hand over the dusty stone. After a long hesitance, she tried to pull the door open, but it didn't budge at all. She bowed her head a long moment before straightening, dusting off her hands.

*What is this place?* the ball asked again, this time in a hushed, hesitant voice.

Jiaojiao didn't answer. They wandered again for a time. This time, Jiaojiao's footsteps becoming more and more urgent, as if she sensed she was closing in on her destination.

"There it is, thank fuck," she muttered.

They had exited the labyrinthian palace and entered a courtyard with distinctly separate architecture. Guang Qiu buzzed, high and excited.

*Isn't this?!*

"Recognize it? You should. You put it here, after all," Jiaojiao said, low and angry.

A facsimile of Bai Xingyue's courtyard lay in a stretch of crumbled stone, as if a meteorite had crashed into a section of the ruined white palace and lodged itself there. 

Jiaojiao stepped warily past the moon door, sneering at the familiar layout, rolling here eyes at the sight of the dreaded outhouse. "It really clashes with the locale, I should have you shot for what you've done to my palace."

*Your palace?!* Guang Qiu said. *This place is yours?*

"Who the fuck else, genius?"

Jiaojiao shook her head, then flicked out her hand, her bedazzled nails flashing in the light. The ground beneath her began to shake, as a sleeping giant were trying to rattle itself free from its prison.

*What... what are you doing?*

 "This place doesn't belong here, of course I'm getting rid of it!"

Guang Qiu's form flashed, dazzling and bright in agitation. *If this place is a result of... you... you're trying to get rid of the Bai Xingyue's memories?!*

"Idiot, even you should understand why I don't want them in my head!" Jiaojiao's eye's showed lines of strain around the corners as her other hand came out to join the first. 

*...how are you doing all this?*

Jiaojiao gave the ball a ridiculing look. "You refuse to tell me anything and think I've going to give you my secrets? How the fuck does that work?"

Okay, Guang Qiu had to admit the mortal had a point.

*You can't do it!* The ball said after a long strained silence. *I admit you have some hidden talent, but it won't be that easy to get rid of Bai Xingyue's spiritual presence. This place, is likely a spiritual construct of your consciousness. I'm surprised you can manifest one so realistic with no cultivation and no formal training, but that's the limit of your ability!*

"Just watch me."

As if to punctuate her point, the corners of the courtyard walls began to fold in on themselves like they were being torn out from a picture scroll. Guang Qiu blared in alarm as the roof shingles began to lift up and shatter into motes of light, disappearing into the sunlight as if like melting snow.

*Don't do this! I realize you're angry, but these memories are important! They are the key to returning destiny to the right path!*

"How many times do I have to tell you?" Jiaojiao forced out between gritted teeth. "I don't have any interest in destiny!"

*Why not? Don't you want the power to do great things?* Guang Qiu scrambled for convincing points. *Don't you want to remembered by history?*

"Not me."

With a scream of stone and shattered pottery, half of Bai Xingyue's residence caved in. Guang Qiu was nearly driven to despair when suddenly, all movement stopped.

Jiaojiao froze, her hair lifting in an invisible current. The door to Bai Xingyue's residence swung open. A familiar face appeared in the doorway, thin, terrible. Hobbling footsteps sounded, and a short, thin figure appeared, her tattered robes floating on a phantom breeze.

Jiaojiao's face, always so composed, was drawn in a rictus of horror as the girl with the marred face stepped into the light, her very form at odds with Jiaojiao's seemed to suck in all the color of the surroundings, leaving a dull monochrome in her shambling wake.

Even Guang Qiu, a being beyond life and death, found shivers crawling up it's non-existent body. 

The two, as if two insects pinned to a board, were unable to move or speak as the spectre limped toward them, expression hidden under a curtain of dark hair.

At last, the ghost of Bai Xingyue stopped in front of Jiaojiao. The curtain of lanky hair fell away from her face, revealing eyes like an abyss, half her face swept by an ugly red mark. The girl, a full foot shorter than Jiaojiao reached out with a corpse-pale hand and gripped Jiaojiao's outstretched hand.

Everything snapped back into place, like a page had been turned in a book. The courtyard returned to its former appearance, shabby and worn, but intact.

The girl sat up in the *kang* with a gasp. Her former beauty, the scenery with the white palace,  disappeared like a figment of the imagination.

*What. How?* Guang Qiu reeled in confusion.

Low laughter sounded in the eerie darknesss

"Isn't this exactly what you wanted?" came a strange voice. Thin, pinched, uncertain.

*...which one are you?*

"I'm not sure I know myself."

There came a confused sound, halfway between a laugh and a sob.

The night passed in a strange blur. Guang Qiu felt some strange disturbance within itself as it listened to the girl weeping and laughing in the dark.

Guang Qiu didn't feel guilt. It was far too old, too accustomed to playing with the lives under his purview. It's job just didn't allow for such emotions.

But just this once. It doubted.
