Cen Wei soon finished combing Jiaojiao's hair and retreated with the dented mirror, smile a touch smugger than before. Jiaojiao didn't care to speculate on the old woman's inner thoughts, as poisonous as they must be.

Guang Qiu went back to its silence, content to float there, unassuming, at least, until Cen Wei came back, arms laden with bamboo strips.

"What's this?" Cen Wei suddenly said with surprise.

Jiaojiao looked over to see the old woman holding a delicately carved bangle in her thick palm. It was made of a shimmery pear wood and seemed far too small to fit on her stout wrist.

*That's--!*

Cen Wei turned the bracelet this way and that, giving Jiaojiao an inquisitive look. "Where did this come from?"

*If my suspicions are correct...* thought Jiaojiao.

*Grab it!* Guang Qiu suddenly screamed in her mind, loud enough to cause Jiaojiao to jolt in alarm.

"That's mine," Jiaojiao said instead with a careful expression. "Can I have it back, please?"

Cen Wei gave her a considering stare, hands rubbing the exquisite bracelet between her hands. "This looks expensive."

"It's really not," Jiaojiao said. "It's fake. I got it for a few coppers."

The furrow between the servant's brows deepened. "When did you buy it? You never leave the estate."

*Woops.* "I asked another servant to buy it for me."

Cen Wei didn't look like she believed her. "Where did you get the money? Who did you ask?"

*This servant really dared.* "Does it matter where I got the money? Now give it to me." Jiaojiao held out her hand, palm up.

"Yueyue!" Cen Wei looked scandalized. "How can a young lady speak like that?"

The bracelet disappeared  into her sleeve. "Don't worry, I will keep this safe for you. You know how forgetful you are! Wouldn't want you to lose such a pretty thing! You know how things sometimes disappear around you."

*Aided largely in part by a certain servant, I would imagine.* Jiaojiao thought sardonically.

*What are you sitting there for?!* Guang Qiu screamed. *Just take it from her, she's but an old woman!*

Jiaojiao stood.

*Wait!* 

Jiaojiao smirked and sat back down.

*You can't get into a conflict with her,* Guang Qiu said, sounding annoyed. *It would derail the plot too much.*

"I must say, you are behaving very oddly!" Cen Wei scolded. "I know you must not be very happy after humiliating yourself, but this is no reason to misbehave!"

*You will have to take it from her unnoticed,* Guang Qiu said wearily. *You cannot allow your relationship with her to sour.*

*The woman is already poisoning me,* Jiaojiao laughed inwardly. *Could the relationship be worse?*

Cen Wei had gone back to stripping the broken bamboo slats from the kang, apparently not feeling even a moment of shame for brazenly stealing from her mistress.

*This impudent servant!* Guang Qiu roared, floating around the old woman and swirling in agitation.

In shortly less than an hour, Cen Wei had patched the bed, deft fingers flying over the frame, evidently used to performing such repairs. Jiaojiao had to wonder how often Bai Xingwu had ruined Bai Xingyue's bed specifically for Cen Wei to become so adept.

*We cannot allow that old woman to get away with that bracelet. It is Bai Jing's artifact!*

*I figured. You wouldn't go batshit over some random piece of jewelry.* Jiaojiao bounced carefully on the newly repaired *kang*. *Speaking of which, why is the bracelet here? If it belongs to Bai Jing, then doesn't that mean she showed up after all?*

Guang Qiu was silent. Digesting this piece of news. 

*Unless of course, you're wrong and that bracelet is just an ordinary piece of jewelry.*

*No, I cannot be wrong about this,* Guang Qiu said. *I don't know why it is here, but this is good news for you. You will be able to heal your leg and cure your poison with that bracelet.*

Bai Jing's bracelet was far from as simple as its appearance suggested. Her mother, the latest heir to an ancient mystical clan, famous for their skills in Chinese medicine, had gifted it to Bai Jing shortly before being murdered by her husband, Bai Jing's father, for control of the Bai family-- not to be confused with the Shaofu realm Bai Family. Anyway, it was all Very Sad.

Bai Jing hid away the bracelet, having been told by her mother that it harbored a very special secret. All through the years she was consigned to a death camp by her own father, she never spoke of it, despite his repeated attempts to persuade the answer out of her. After all, Bai Jing had been the sole witness to her mothers murder at her father's hands. 

Bai Jing could only watch helplessly as her father took control of her mother's clan and all its businesses. Could only look as her father swiftly married his secret mistress, even bringing home a half-sister the same age as her. Could only keep to herself and plot revenge in the dark while her half-sister lived in the light, taking everything that should have been hers.

She guarded against this den of vipers all her life, building up her own strength, hoping one day to burst out with a revenge worthy of the history books. She honed her skills killing her targets, each time imagining her own father's face as she cut them down, even as every move she made was at the discretion of *that man*. She spent every free moment learning about medicine, both western and eastern, not wanting to shame her clan's legacy, planning for the day when she would wrench control of the clan from her father's cold dead hands.

Who knew that half-sister would send her lover to seduce Bai Jing in a strange bid for the rumored inheritance of the mystical Bai Family, causing Bai Jing to trip up in the dumbest way possible.

Having lost her life in such a hackneyed, cliched manner, Bai Jing was luckily saved by her mother's artifact. Inside slept a celestial tiger, which whisked her soul away to the world of Shaofu, where she was reborn as the crippled girl, Bai Xingyue.

The bracelet was a magical item that harbored a secret space inside that defied common sense. It had various features such as the ability to store food indefinitely with no chance of it degrading. Plants grew faster in this pocket dimension as well, and there was even a luxurious pavilion with a library of secret martial arts texts. Plants grew faster in the soil, an advantage that Bai Jing exploited throughout her career dominating the world of Shaofu. She would use the space to nurture medicinal plants, supplying her alchemy with an endless crop of ingredients. Not to mention there was a celestial tiger that would become Bai Jing's willing lackey and body guard during her more vulnerable days.

In other words, the space was an indispensable part of Bai Jing's strength.

*Tonight, when she has gone to bed, you will sneak into her room--*

*Oh sure,* Jiaojiao said. *Just watch me, I'll be shadow itself with this bum leg.*

*Bai Jing would--*

Jiaojiao massaged her forehead. *Not Bai Jing, Hello? Have you been paying attention at all?*

Guang Qiu's light levels dimmed, and the room simmered in its discontent. *You will get that bracelet one way or another. You must. Or I will get rid of you.*

Jiaojiao covered her mouth as a yawn forced tears from her eyes. "Can I do it later? I'm tired. Besides, she said she's going out for errands and it's not like this body is capable of running her down."

The ball's angry reply was lost as Jiaojiao laid back on the *kang* and fell asleep in a daze. 

*Isekai. Why did I have to be isekai'ed?* Jiaojiao's tired mind spiraled, confused. *Clearly I haven't even brushed the bumper of a white truck or crossed paths with an insane slasher? Why me? Isn't this sort of bullshit supposed to happen to virgin salarymen?*

Jiaojiao hadn't had a perfect life, but it was damn close. She was rich, famous, and admired by 13 million fans at the lastest count. She didn't lack for anything. She was a trust-fund baby for fucks sake, she didn't have any of the hallmarks typical of isekai victims. She wasn't disastified with the status quo. She had no outstanding traumas. She wasn't bullied, aside from some of the more poisonous voices denoucing her as shallow, fake, etc, she hadn't encountered much negativity at all. In fact, she was often praised for being young and successful--though some bitter voices would attribute all her accomplishments to her background as the young heir to the huge MEI conglomerate.

She had friends. Well, maybe they weren't quite as genuine as some, but she had a wide circle of acquaintances who were (somewhat) invested in her wellbeing. And she had...

Devika. She had forgotten Devika. She had to ask Guang Qiu if she was okay. If whatever killed her had killed Devika too, then where was she?

How had she died anyway? She hadn't had the chance to ask Guang Qiu in all the chaotic aftermath of her sudden transmigration.

*Isn't transmigration trendy?* Jiaojiao thought, somewhat hysterically to herself. *And I pride myself on being trendy, right? Maybe it's a little tired, but people still like reading about it, right?*

The kang creaked as Jiaojiao's body turned fitfully, her mind unable to rest as she fell deeper into dreams. 

*She looks out the broken window, rubble crumbling over the edges of the sill. Dust lingered in the cracks and crevices between the stones. Ivy trails curled and spun over the walls. She sees a shimmering valley in the distance, but she knows there is nothing there for her. She turns away and treads familiar steps down the corridor, shattered stone litters the path but she steps over them with practiced footwork.*

*Checkered sunlight streams across the hall. Dusty footprints chase her steps. Not a sound is made. She comes to a door, half open, half closed. She pushes past and walks inside into a room with only one occupant. He is waiting for her, as he always is.*

*I died today. But you weren't there.*

*He doesn't speak. He never does. But he smiles.*

Jiaojiao woke in a start as someone shook her awake.

"Yueyue! Did you sleep well?"

Jiaojiao held her head, still half lost in dreams. "What do you want?"

"Yueyue," Cen Wei shook her again, rougher this time. "It's time for dinner."

Guang Qiu popped into existence by her ear just as Jiaojiao was about to take her first bite.

*Don't eat it. There's poison!*

Jiaojiao ignored it and took a difficult mouthful of worm-eaten cabbage.

The ball seemed shocked into silence. For all of two seconds. Then it screamed. *What are you doing?! Did you not hear me, mortal? Poison! I said there is poison!*

*I heard you.* Jiaojiao shot back irritably. *What do you think the old woman would do if I refused to eat? Didn't you say I had to keep a good relationship with her for The Plot? Besides, this body is on the verge of keeling over from starvation. If you want me to be of any use, don't I need the strength?*

*You are eating poison,* the ball retorted. *It's already killing you. I did a scan of your body as you slept--*

*Um, invasive much?*

*And the body is not long for this world if the rate of poison is not stemmed.*

*Well, the body has been poisoned all its life,* Jiaojiao reasoned. *One more meal won't kill it.*

Guang Qiu grumbled some more, but didn't refute this.

Jiaojiao choked down another half bowl of gruel before she couldn't force herself to go on, honestly she was proud that she had done as well as she had.

*This has been the worst day of my life,* Jiaojiao told the ball with a dreary resignation as she watched Cen Wei rinse out the bowl in a bucket of well water-- not the same bucket she had used earlier that day thankfully. 

*You are too pampered,* the ball sneered. *You call this much suffering? How soft you are.*

Jiaojiao didn't argue. She was indeed a pampered, soft, and delicate existence. The worst thing she'd eaten prior to today had been a slightly sour yogurt she'd left in the fridge too long.

"Cen Wei," Jiaojiao said suddenly. "Can I see a doctor about my leg?"

This entreaty was enough for Cen Wei to drop a bowl. It shattered in half on the cobblestones and the pieces wobbled back and forth, emitting sounds like jeering laughter.

"What?" Cen Wei, eyes wide. "You want to fix your leg?"

"Is something wrong?" Jiaojiao asked. 

"You can't!"

"Why?"

"There--" Cen Wei licked her lips. "There's no money."

Jiaojiao didn't speak.

"Besides, why would you want to fix your leg? It's been so long, miss. I'm afraid..."

The rest went unspoken, but the implication was there. That the leg was too far gone to fix. That she should be content to spend the rest of her life a cripple. Cen Wei's deliberately bitter smile was ripe with untold sympathy.

*Hey she makes a good point,* Jiaojiao said to Guang Qiu. *We're broke.*

Jiaojiao could almost hear the ball's scream of frustration.

*We will cross that bridge when we come to it.* 

Jiaojiao shrugged, then hobbled toward the outhouse.

"Do you need help, young miss?" Cen Wei said, relief evident in her voice that her master had dropped the subject.

"I'll be fine," Jiaojiao said.

Guang Qiu had excused itself the second Jiaojiao made moves toward the outhouse, no doubt afraid of mortal filth. But Jiaojiao didn't enter the outhouse. Instead, she hesitated for a long, long moment before picking up the three-foot long shovel leaning against the side, expression fraught with distress.

She hefted the smooth handle, trying her damndest to ignore the stench wafting off the rusted iron head. Flecks of... matter remained despite its bath earlier in the day. *Don't think about it, don't think about it.*

Cen Wei was still scrubbing dishes when Jiaojiao quietly came up behind her and whacked her in the head with the shovel. She fell forward, but caught herself on the edge of the bucket in front of her. Expression livid, she turned in time to catch the second hit with her forehead. 

"Yueyue!" She screamed, holding her face. Jiaojiao hit her again. It took five hits before the old woman finally slumped over into unconciousness.

Jiaojiao frowned, looking at the old woman collapsed facedown on the ground, then the shovel. "What the hell is her head made of?"

Guang Qiu chose this moment to pop back into existence. *Mortal! What have you done!?*
