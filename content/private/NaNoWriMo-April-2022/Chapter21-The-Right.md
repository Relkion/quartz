There was a frigid silence as the implications of Mo Wudi's words hit Jiaojiao like one of Dian Zhuo's hammer blows.

*"I spoke with her, before she drowned in my pond."*

*"I was the last one to see her alive."*

Jiaojiao smile didn't slip, but the hairs on the back of her neck were standing up like cactus spines. "I'm not sure what you mean? I am not Bai Xingyue, so I don't recognize you at all--"

"I'm the thirteenth prince."

*Shit.*

"You already knew that."

Jiaojiao shot Guang Qiu an urgent message. *Hello? Are you hearing this? I'm about to die!*

Guang Qiu was apparently offline, because it simply hovered there, unresponsive.

Yes. It was now very apparent that Mo Wudi had no intention of letting Jiaojiao go.

His identity as the thirteenth prince was one of his most closely guarded secrets. In the webnovel, he had killed numerous times to keep his two identities separate, always in cruel, bloody fashion.

What Jiaojiao didn't understand was why he was being so open with her.

She sighed, and poured herself another cup of tea. "What gave me away?"

"You avoided me too eagerly."

Jiaojiao gave pause, her lips quirking up around her teacup. "Have you seen yourself lately? If I don't avoid strange men with demon masks then I would be the strange one."

"You avoided my left side in the clinic, even though it would have been a shorter route to the door."

In the webnovel, Mo Wudi had been described as being very guarded against those who approached his left, because of a childhood injury. In one instance, a servant had accidentally bumped his left and lost an arm for it. There was a good reason Jiaojiao had behaved as she had, but it seemed to have backfired.

"I saw a cockroach on the wall."

"There was no cockroach." A pause. "I would have seen it."

"What is the point of this conversation? Even if I hadn't known you were the thirteenth prince, I certainly know now. What next? Going to kill me to silence me?"

Mo Wudi raised an elegant hand, each joint finely boned, flesh spotless like the porcelain of his mask. He lifted the mask from his face, revealing his facial features.

Jiaojiao froze with the teacup halfway to her lips. 

"There's no need to kill you," the beautiful idol across from Jiaojiao said, placing the mask down with a faint *tink*.

"Rank 2. Definitely rank 2," Jiaojiao muttered, almost feverishly.

"What?" the beautiful face scrunched the tiniest of fractions, causing Jiaojiao undue distress.

"Don't frown, it will cause wrinkles."

"... as I was saying, there is no need to kill you, but you will tell me who sent you."

"I don't understand," Jiaojiao said, finally getting her dazzled eyes in order. "Who sent me? No one *sent* me."

She then paused, remembering the ball, who's server still had not rebooted. *Well, technically...*

"You're lying," Mo Wudi said, deathly calm, but with the promise of violence.

"I'm not *lying* persay, I'm just not sure how much of the truth you can handle."

Mo Wudi stared at Jiaojiao, expression not changing a flicker. She wasn't even certain he was breathing. With an atmosphere as fragile as glass, there was only the distant, muffled sound of hammer blows coming from the smithy to denote the passage of time.

"I will come back when you are ready to talk," he said at last, rising with an easily fluidity, like that of a jungle cat. He replaced the mask on his face, then left with barely a displacement of air despite his speed.

Jiaojiao hummed in the relaxed silence of his departure. "What a charming fellow. Very intense."

She didn't doubt that past five minutes were the most dangerous she'd experienced since transmigrating. Not even getting mugged by Tu Wenfeng, with a dagger at her neck had she felt as close to death as she had been in the presence of Mo Wudi's suspicion.

*You need to leave,* Guang Qiu said. *You need to leave right away.*

*Are you finally rebooted?* Jiaojiao asked, perking up.

*There has been a great shift in the plot. You cannot handle what will come next if this goes on. That boy truly means to kill you.*

*Yeah, I already got that message. But how? You think I can outrun that guy? I can't even outrun Granny Chu in this body.*

*Take off the splint.*

*But it hasn't been a week yet.*

*That doctor was just fooling you. The leg was already healed on the second day.*

"No way. Are you screwing with me?!"

*I'm sure he was very smug with his trick.*

*And you didn't think to tell me?* Jiaojiao glared.

A wave of petty emotion wafted off the ball.

*All right. It was I who expected too much.* Jiaojiao shook her head and began to pick apart the bandages around her leg. It had been three days and the poor conditions of the temple, especially the mudslinging event, had contributed a layer of grime to the hemp cloth despite her efforts to keep herself clean.

When the two lengths of wood clattered to the tea room floor, she bent the stiff muscles experimentally, eyes lighting up when aside from some faint softness in the muscle from disuse, she did not feel any of the pain or discomfort she could expect prior her visit to Doctor Tai.

*All right, I'll admit that poor quack wasn't without skill,* Jiaojiao said, standing with the aid of her staff. She took some hesitant steps toward the door, then stopped.

*How do I get out? I don't know the layout of this place. And how do I avoid being seen?*

The ball zipped to the front of Jiaojiao and it suddenly hurt Jiaojiao's eyes to look at him, as if someone had nudged the brightness level of their phone to the max. 

*What are you doing?* Jiaojiao said, shifting backward. She had gotten used to the ball's lack of initiative, and this sudden display of power left her unsettled.

*It won't last for long. I suggest you make a run for the front door.*

Jiaojiao decided the trust the ball, just this once. She opened the sliding door panel carefully, peeking though the crack. When she saw no one in the hallway, she darted out, only slightly favoring her right leg. Carefully closing the door behind her, she made a run for it, only slowing down to turn corners.

When she almost ran into a boy dressed like smithy apprentice in the halls, she thought she had been caught, but the boy merely continued to walk toward her. She dodged to the side as he passed and he made no indication he'd seen her. 

Jiaojiao stared at the ball. *So you're not just a useless lightbulb.*

*Would you move quickly? I can't hold this state for long.*

Jiaojiao made it past the front door with no more trouble. She didn't see Mo Wudi, and had no interest in seeing him. She spotted Dian Zhuo laboring at the anvil in the smithy but didn't stop to chat.

When she was out the courtyard door, it didn't take long to locate Tu Wenfeng, who was dozing nearby on the side of the street, leaning against his badly repaired rickshaw.

Jiaojiao thumped him on the shoulder as she passed. "I have the money. We need to go."

Tu Wenfeng shot up as Yanyan herself were beckoning him. His eyes were bright and his cheeks flushed. "How much?"

"Enough. I'll give it to you once you drop me off where we first met."

He frowned. "You're not going back to the temple?"

Jiaojiao looked at him. "You want me to go back with you?"

"No..." he stared at the ground. "Rui Si will miss you."

Jiaojiao shook her head, and simply sat down in the rickshaw. Tu Wenfeng gave a startled look at her leg. "It's healed."

"It has *been* healed, apparently," Jiaojiao said through gritted teeth.

Tu Wenfeng no longer spoke and turned the cart into traffic. Jiaojiao kept a watchful eye on the courtyard door, but no masked demons came darting out to chop her in two.

She only relaxed when the cart a squeaked a kilometer away. Guang Qiu had become a pale visage of its past self.

*You okay?*

*I expended too much energy. I will be fine in a few days.*

Jiaojiao nodded. So she couldn't expect anymore invisibility power-ups. *Got it.*

Tu Wenfeng dropped her off on the same road she'd first encountered him. Jiaojiao eased herself off the cart, bouncing on her newly healed leg. She counted out five hundred silver taels in the privacy of her sleeve before handing it over to Tu Wenfeng, wrapped in some cleaner parts of the hemp bandage.

"Don't spend it all on Yanyan." Jiaojiao sneered.

Tu Wenfeng's eyes grew shimmery with tears, he bent his head low and splotches of wetness fell to the dusty ground.  His broad shoulders shook with suppressed tremors. "Thank you."

"Yeah, whatever. It's been nice knowing you." Jiaojiao waved and turned to leave.

"Are you sure you won't come back with me?" Tu Wenfeng called after her. "Rui Si will cry when she hears."

Jiaojiao turned her head, a wry smile on her lips. "You're not an idiot, you probably already know who I am." Or at least who this body was. And a girl with as many enemies as her couldn't stay in that place. Who knew what would happen? Mo Wudi alone was enough to raze the place to the ground with a careless flick of his sleeve.

Tu Wenfeng turned red. "We will always welcome you."

Jiaojiao smirked. "Who would want to stay in that run-down place anyway?"

Tu Wenfeng bowed low again, a solemn dignity in his movements, and Jiaojiao could almost see the shadow of *Black Wind*. "Bai Xingyue, we won't forget you. I'm sorry for how we treated you."

Jiaojiao felt a strange stirring in her chest. She looked down, frowning.

"Say goodbye to Rui Si for me. She's a smart girl. She won't do badly as long as she remembers my advice."

Jiaojiao didn't look back again.

*What do we do now?* Guang Qiu fretted. *Mo Wudi won't leave this alone. He knows where you live. He will come after you sooner or later. We have to think of countermeasures--*

"Hey."

*What?! I'm trying to think, mortal, don't interrupt me!*

"Haven't you thought about it?"

*Thought about what?* Guang Qiu asked irritably.

Jiaojiao walked along the deserted road, appreciating the quiet, the carefree birds darting and singing in the shadows of the trees. A breeze shuffled the leaves, sending a whispering through the stillness. "Bai Xingyue."

*What nonsense are you speaking now?* Guang Qiu grumbled. *She's dead, what of it?*

"You haven't ever wondered what she would think about all this?"

*Why would I care?  She's just some lowly mortal.*

Jiaojiao stopped and allowed the light and shadow play over her hands, staring at the cracked nails, the purple tint of poison still lingering in her veins.

"She lived a miserable life, didn't she? I wonder if she had a single happy moment in the fifteen years she lived on this earth."

The misery of Bai Xingyue wasn't something Jiaojiao had taken the time to think about. She hadn't allowed herself to dwell on it. The morality of stealing another person's body, living their life, breathing the air that should have been theirs, was something that would bother her, even if she was vain and selfish. She wasn't a monster after all.

"You know who would have been a great protagonist?”

*You aren't speaking sense.*

"Bai Xingyue."

*You--*

"When Bai Jing didn't show up, why didn't you ever think about resurrecting Bai Xingyue? What was it about me that was so important you'd pass over the most obvious choice? No. It could be argued that Bai Xingyue is the *only* choice."

Guang Qiu didn't speak.

"Who has more right than the original owner of this body? Who more qualified?" Jiaojiao laughed, mirthless, cold. "In my opinion, Bai Jing should never come here. If Bai Xingyue couldn't have this life, then no one should have it."

*You don't understand,* Guang Qiu said. *You don't understand anything, mortal. Without Bai Jing, the order of this world is in peril. Bai Jing is more worthy of this body than Bai Xingyue--*

Jiaojiao gave an angry bark of laughter. "To say that another person is more worthy of living in this body, than the original owner." Jiaojiao looked at the ball. "What gives you the right? What gives you the fucking right?"
