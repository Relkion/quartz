<p>Jiaojiao woke suddenly, when a handful of something wet and smelly landed on her face. She coughed and grabbed at the mess, coming away with a handful of mud. Min Tong hovered some distance away, giggling into his hands, then jolted when Jiaojiao gave him a distant look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guai! You leave Rui Si alone!&rdquo; he shouted, backing away.</p>
<p>Jiaojiao didn&rsquo;t dignify the little cretin with a response, too busy pulling more bits of mud out of her hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you listening, Guai?&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Say, Guang Qiu, do I look like I&rsquo;m easy to push around? First you, Cen Wei, that quack, the idiot rickshaw driver, and even this monkey. All of you seem to believe that I&rsquo;m a kind person that won&rsquo;t hit back when bullied?</em></p>
<p>Guang Qiu floated lazily overhead, radiating waves of shadenfreude . <em>I don&rsquo;t know what you did in your past life, but it seems you don&rsquo;t have much good karma accumulated.</em></p>
<p><em>Nonsense,</em> Jiaojiao&rsquo;s smile got even colder when more children appeared in the doorway of the room, all with handfuls of mud clutched in their hands. <em>If good people had good ends, then why is there injustice in this world? If anything, the fact that I&rsquo;m being bullied means that I&rsquo;ve simply been too nice.</em></p>
<p>Jiaojiao reached for her stick, which she&rsquo;d placed by her side when she&rsquo;d gone to bed. Her whole body ached after sleeping on the straw mat over a hard wooden floor, but big plus&ndash;no cockroaches had crawled into her mouth in the night. She pulled the mask off her face and stowed it in her sleeve. The children drew back, seeing her marked face uncovered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; she told them. &ldquo;Throw that mud. See what happens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The children hesitated, looking to Min Tong for guidance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throw it! She can&rsquo;t chase after you! She&rsquo;s lame!&rdquo; Min Tong shouted, puffing out his chest.</p>
<p>The first child threw his handful of mud, but it fell short and splattered uselessly on the ground by Jiaojiao&rsquo;s feet. More children joined in, until they had all pitched their handfuls.</p>
<p>Only three shots landed on Jiaojiao at all, the others hitting the ground or the walls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll remember you,&rdquo; Jiaojiao said, her smile tranquil. &ldquo;You should know that vengeful ghosts never forget the faces of those that wrong them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The children paled, then ran away en mass, leaving Min Tong to face Jiaojiao alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you very proud?&rdquo; Jiaojiao asked Min Tong. &ldquo;Will Rui Si thank you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if on cue, Rui Si ran into the room, her face scrunched up in distress. &ldquo;Jiaojiao!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; Jiaojiao said, rising from the floor with the aide of her staff. She leisurely brushed most of the mud off her robes and hair, as if they were stray snowflakes and not mud from who knows where.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Min Tong, why did you get the others to throw mud at Jiaojiao?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a guai! You shouldn&rsquo;t talk with her anymore. What if she&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not a ghost, she&rsquo;s nice! She made me a bracelet!&rdquo; Rui Si thrust out her thin wrist.</p>
<p>Min Tong slapped her hand away. &ldquo;Why are you wearing these things? You think they will make you prettier?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rui Si ducked her head, tugging at her veil with a trembling hand. &ldquo;Why do you have to be so mean to Jiaojiao? She is very kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be fooled by her. Just look at her face, she&rsquo;s so ugly, she must have done evil&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Min Tong, I hate you!&rdquo; Rui Si said to the stricken boy and turned to bury her face in Jiaojiao&rsquo;s hip, not caring about the mud at all.</p>
<p>Jiaojiao gloated at the pale-faced boy. &ldquo;Idiot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Min Tong&rsquo;s eyes leaked angry tears as he punched the door frame and stalked off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; Jiaojiao asked the little girl.</p>
<p>Rui Si sniffed and pulled away from Jiaojiao, wiping residual tears from her eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to be friends with Min Tong anymore!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you ever friends?&rdquo; Jiaojiao asked curiously.</p>
<p>She stared at the floor. &ldquo;He shares food with me sometimes. Granny Hua doesn&rsquo;t give me much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao&rsquo;s smile turned very brittle. It seemed she needed to have some words with <em>some</em> people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You like him because he&rsquo;s kind to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to be a great monk in the future. He said he will become an immortal and make sure every kid here has enough to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From what Jiaojiao gathered from the book, the great sects did recruit children who had great potential to train into productive members of their sects, but did a child from the slum have this opportunity? Not unless he truly was very gifted. Did Min Tong fall into this category? Why didn&rsquo;t she see it?</p>
<p>Rui Si tentatively brushed more dirt from Jiaojiao&rsquo;s side, then pulled at her sleeve. &ldquo;I know where to get clothes, come with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two of them limped and stepped into the halls of the ruined temple, striding past leaky windows and cracked beams until they came to a wide room with some chipped furniture stacked up on one side and some cupboards on the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are some old clothes from some big sister that married away from here some years ago,&rdquo; Rui Si whispered. &ldquo;I sometimes come here to play when no one else wants to play with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao imagined a lonely little girl hiding in this big empty room, playing in the dim light from the shadowed windows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do the other children often not want to play with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rui Si clutched at the cloth on her face. &ldquo;Granny Hua says that only people who led wicked lives in their past reincarnation end up with deformities. Or maybe my parents were criminals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao shook her head, lip curled. &ldquo;Whether your parents were criminals or saints, what relation does that have to do with you? We come into this world alone and we die alone. Why should we bear the sins of others? As for whether you were wicked in a past life, all that matters is that I don&rsquo;t see a wicked person in front of me now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rui Si looked up at Jiaojiao with wide eyes, as if this chicken soup was the elixir to cure all her ills. Jiaojiao coughed and looked away, unable to meet that naive gaze head on. This is why she planned to never have her own children. What if she screwed them up?</p>
<p>&ldquo;So don&rsquo;t worry about being friends with that idiot, Min Tong. If he doesn&rsquo;t like you, there are always others who will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the leader,&rdquo; Rui Si looked down. &ldquo;If he doesn&rsquo;t like you, none of them will like you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t need any of them,&rdquo; Jiaojiao squatted with difficulty to get at eye level with the little girl. &ldquo;Sometimes it&rsquo;s better to have one very good friend that sticks with you always, than to have a lot of them that throw you aside whenever it suits them. Besides, aren&rsquo;t you here with me? Or do you want to throw mud at me too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not! I like you, Big Sister!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have good taste,&rdquo; Jiaojiao said, patting the girl on the head.</p>
<p>Jiaojiao found some passable clothing to change into, a dull blue thing that had been washed so many times it had become grey. She tsked at the baggy fit, planning to ask Granny Hua for some thread and a needle later.</p>
<p>The two girls found some bricks&ndash;or mantou to choke down with some millet gruel, the children dodging out of the way when they came into the dining area.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know where Tu Wenfeng is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He leaves to work before everyone else wakes up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao wondered if he&rsquo;d make any money at all with the bracelets she and Rui Si made the day before. It was hard to gauge whether the ancient peoples had the same aesthetic as those from her old world, after all, so many other things were different, especially beauty standards.</p>
<p>This era favored plump, soft women, bearded men, and loose fitting clothes that seemed to go on with miles of fabric, all out of style for her time.</p>
<p>Jiaojiao didn&rsquo;t have anything to do for the rest of the day. She soon grew very very bored, longing for the past where any random google search could lead her down a bottomless rabbit hole. Why, she could content herself scrolling through various shades of nail polish. Rui Si seemed perfectly content to stick by her side, sitting in the shade of the building on some crooked stools that had seen better days.</p>
<p>Granny Hua led a harried existence, running back and forth minding the various chores around the temple. She swept the yard, her old back craned over the too-short broom. Then she washed linens and hung them out with the help of some of the older children. She washed dishes. She changed the diapers of the youngest child, who could barely walk and tottered about in only a stained dudou. Jiaojiao watched her with yakety sax playing in her head. What else could she do for entertainment?</p>
<p>She tried to talk to Guang Qiu, attempting to squeeze more information out of him, but he was especially tightlipped today.</p>
<p>Just when she thought she would die of boredom and leave Guang Qiu with yet another vacancy, Tu Wenfeng rushed into the yard, eyes bright, the rickshaw nearly toppling over with his reckless charge. The children yelled and streamed to him like he was a magnet pulling iron filings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I made money!&rdquo; he said to Jiaojiao.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an interesting way to phrase it,&rdquo; Jiaojiao said.</p>
<p>He turned red. &ldquo;I meant to say, the things you made yesterday sold very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rui Si jumped up and laughed. &ldquo;How much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tu Wenfeng&rsquo;s expression became guarded. &ldquo;I&mldr;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rui Si cocked her head. &ldquo;Do you need help counting it? Is there a lot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wants to lie and pocket some of it for himself,&rdquo; Jiaojjiao explained to Rui Si, who&rsquo;s eyes turned red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tutu, you&rsquo;re very bad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I need the money more than you do!&rdquo; he argued at last, hand going to his sleeve as if Jiaojiao would jump up and fight him for it.</p>
<p>Jiaojiao gave him a bored look. &ldquo;To you, Yanyan is the most important thing in the world, but to me, she&rsquo;s just some person who is causing my business partner to cheat me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk about Yanyan that way!&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Guang Qiu, wasn&rsquo;t this idiot supposed to be a badass in the book? What is this brainless, money-grubbing simp?</em></p>
<p><em>He&rsquo;s not had a chance to change into what he should. And he might never become that person if you continue to meddle,</em> Guang Qiu warned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you plan to keep a cut of the money, then that means there will be less capital for materials,&rdquo; Jiaojiao shook her head. &ldquo;You are bleeding the business before it even has a chance to get off its feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we just keep doing what we did before?&rdquo; he argued. &ldquo;The scraps don&rsquo;t cost a lot of money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Imbecile. I simply can&rsquo;t converse with you. It&rsquo;s like talking to a pig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pig-head!&rdquo; Rui Si agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You promised you would help me,&rdquo; Tu Wenfeng said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you continue to conduct yourself like a leech, then I will treat you like one and cut you off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leech!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tu Wenfeng pointed at Jiaojiao, teeth bared. Her eyes widened. Was this guy on drugs? What was going on?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will help me, or I will throw you out of this place!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rui Si, he&rsquo;s throwing me out,&rdquo; Jiaojiao placed a hand on her brow. &ldquo;Whatever shall I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tutu,&rdquo; Rui Si looked up at the teenager, wet with a sheen of tears. &ldquo;Why are you being so mean to Jiaojiao?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s just some beggar I picked up! If she can&rsquo;t earn her keep, then she doesn&rsquo;t have a place here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you own the temple?&rdquo; Jiaojiao asked, feigning confusion. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t realize I was speaking to a landlord!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tu Wenfeng choked. &ldquo;I might not be the owner, but I brought you back. I can drive you out too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then try it. I hope your Yanyan enjoys her new job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was quite evidently the wrong thing to say as Tu Wenfeng leapt forward and grabbed the front of Jiaojiao&rsquo;s robes. Unfortunately, Jiaojiao&rsquo;s staff angled just the right way caught him in the throat.</p>
<p>The teenager went down, wheezing, eyes bulging as he clutched at his throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Idiots will be idiots, I suppose,&rdquo; Jiaojiao tsked. &ldquo;Come on Rui Si, let&rsquo;s go inside. Let&rsquo;s ask Granny Hua for some thread. I can make you a new set of clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rui Si cheered and helped Jiaojiao hobble upright.</p>
<p>Children gathered around the fallen Tu Wenfeng, concerned for the wheezing boy. They gave Jiaojiao fearful looks and one ran to find Granny Hua.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you she was a guai!&rdquo; Min Tong trumpeted.</p>
<p>Granny Hua didn&rsquo;t blink an eye at the chaos. She handed Jiaojiao a set of sewing supplies and then tutted, patting Tu Wenfeng on the back. &ldquo;Why are you children fighting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have unreconcilable differences. Besides, he&rsquo;s a thief and a cheat who owes me money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tutu, what is going on?&rdquo; Granny Hua heaved a deep sigh, her gnarled hands coming to rest on Tu Wenfeng&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;I know you care for that girl but that is no reason to behave immorally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tu Wenfeng bowed his head, chastised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This boy has completely lost his head,&rdquo; Jiaojiao shook her head. &ldquo;I showed him a way to make money, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;ll work for free. Why does he not understand common sense?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Granny Hua glared at Tu Wenfeng. &ldquo;I already looked the other way when you stopped donating your earnings to the temple. I should remind you, the rickshaw belongs to me. If you can&rsquo;t see sense, then I will take it back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <em>snap.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tu Wenfeng bowed his head so low his nose nearly touched his knees. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Granny Hua, please don&rsquo;t take away the rickshaw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much money is it anyway?&rdquo; Granny Hua sighed. &ldquo;Five silver taels? Six? Is this little bit enough for you to lie and cheat? What will you become if it&rsquo;s a hundred taels?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s twenty taels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Granny Hua&rsquo;s eyes widened, looking back and forth between Tu Wenfeng and Jiaojiao with her milky eyes. &ldquo;Twenty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tu Wenfeng nodded, slowly drawing a bulging cloth bag from his sleeve. &ldquo;I sold the first one for five <em>xiao qian</em>, but they were selling too fast, so I asked for ten, then fifteen <em>xiao qian</em>. Then a wealthy man came and bought the rest for ten taels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao looked at Tu Wenfeng, who had his chin jutted out like a proud rooster. She could only sneer, looking at this fool who had lost touch of reality for want of cash. &ldquo;Are you very happy? Do you think you made a good deal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Tu Wenfeng scowled. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If my guess isn&rsquo;t wrong, that same person who bought the rest of the bracelets only wanted to study them.
