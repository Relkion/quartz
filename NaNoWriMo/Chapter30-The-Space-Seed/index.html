<p>Jiaojiao blinked sullenly at the triumphant ball, its strobing lights exacerbating her headache.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you wake me?&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Look mortal! I have solved our problem!</em></p>
<p>Jiaojiao squinted down at the minuscule black speck it spat into her palm. If she breathed too hard, it might go flying off and she&rsquo;d never find it again. For a second she was tempted. &ldquo;A poppy seed?&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Fool! It is far more precious and powerful than a mere poppy seed!</em> It blustered, light bursting in apparent happiness and pride, as if it were a peacock spreading its plumes.</p>
<p>Jiaojiao regarded the dot suspiciously. &ldquo;Do I eat it?&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Imbecile! Have you learned nothing? You must bind if with a drop of blood!</em></p>
<p>Jiaojiao raised her head and prayed for patience from some unknown god. &ldquo;I have to stab myself again? Isn&rsquo;t this the third time already?&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Just do it!!</em></p>
<p>A few minute later, after sanitizing the needle once again with a candle flame, a drop of crimson blood fell onto the black speck, splashing onto the table underneath.</p>
<p>A second passed. Two. &ldquo;Looks like another d&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao fell back, cracking her head painfully on the wooden boards as the speck of black flew up and forcefully struck her between the eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Govnosos!</em>"[^1] she growled, curling up on her side and holding her head. &ldquo;Guang Qiu, you mother<em>fucker</em>!&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Mortal! Are you all right?</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Zaebis'!</em>[^2] You&rsquo;re trying to kill me aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Don&rsquo;t be dramatic! It&rsquo;s merely the seed binding itself to you.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;By punching me in the face? Good <em>god</em> that <em>hurts</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Jiaojiao thought her migraine from Bai Xingyue&rsquo;s memories was terrible enough, she was sorely mistaken. She could physically feel the tiny seed burrowing into her mind, like a living creature, scratching out a space for itself. Given her most recent painful experiences, getting her leg broken, which had been the king for all of three days before being edged out by If Bai Xingyue&rsquo;s memories as the new ten on the discomfort scale, her current feelings hovered around twenty or so.</p>
<p>She was in <em>agony</em>.</p>
<p>She drifted in and out of consciousness for an indeterminate amount of time, too wracked with pain to even cry out. This wasn&rsquo;t a physical pain, but one, Jiaojiao reasoned, came from the soul.</p>
<p>What was happening?</p>
<p>She could dimly perceive the ball hovering over her, having its own panic attack at her apparent crisis.</p>
<p><em>What&rsquo;s wrong mortal? What has happened? This is all wrong! He never mentioned something like this!</em></p>
<p>He? Who was this <em>he?</em></p>
<p>By the time Jiaojiao peeled herself off the floor, the room was in complete darkness save for the dimmest red glow of the setting sun washing the room in a pale pink. A fractured piece of wood caught on her hand. She frowned down at the crack in the floor, rather than the splinter that had lodged itself in the flesh of her thumb. Had that always been there?</p>
<p>Her eyes were puffy from physiological tears. She scrubbed the tear tracks from her face with the edge of her sleeve, wrinkling her nose as she sniffled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever since I&rsquo;ve transmigrated, it&rsquo;s been nothing but a series of painful of experiences, each one in a hurry to top the last!&rdquo; she growled at the ball, her voice scratchy.</p>
<p><em>I just don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s the matter!</em> The ball protested. <em>It should have been a simple binding! How was I to know it would cause you so much pain! Are you sure you&rsquo;re not just&mldr;</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Not just what? Huh? I dare you to finish that sentence.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>&mldr;nevermind.</em></p>
<p>Jiaojiao sneered and brushed the dust off her robes. &ldquo;What was that anyway? A space seed? Is it meant to replace Bai Jing&rsquo;s artifact?&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Yes! Precisely! You should be thankful, mortal! I just gave you a great gift!</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Heh, are you sure I shouldn&rsquo;t be thanking a mysterious <em>&lsquo;he&rsquo;</em>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guang Qiu squawked like a chicken grabbed by the throat. <em>W-what? What he? Don&rsquo;t speak nonsense.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Jiaojiao relented. &ldquo;How do I use it?&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>&mldr;there should be a perception of another space attached to your conciousness. You merely need to&ndash;</em></p>
<p>There was a shift in the surroundings. Jiaojiao and Guang Qiu stood on a mossy bank, surrounded by mist and fog on all sides. The damp curled around the edges of Jiaojiao&rsquo;s robes, her skin grew damp with humidity, and her eyelashes beaded with moisture.</p>
<p>A grey perpetual twilight pervaded the surrounding area, no larger than twenty meters across. There was no sun, and no sky, overhead, a uniform gray expanse stretched out, it&rsquo;s distance immeasurable. A pond lay at Jiaojiao&rsquo;s feet, clear waters with smooth dark stones lay within depths of only a meter. Within the pond, about five meters across, was a small island with a sapling tree, that grew to about knee-height. Beads of water sparkled among its silvery branches and lush elliptical leaves.</p>
<p>Underfoot, springy moss with tiny white flowers left Jiaojiao&rsquo;s feet feeling as if they&rsquo;d stepped on a cloud with her bare feet. She reached down to press a palm on the soft velvety texture.</p>
<p><em>Why is it so&mldr;</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;So what?&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Lacking?</em></p>
<p>Jiaojiao shrugged. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re asking me? What did you expect? Bai Jing&rsquo;s magical pavilion with servants and an overpowered guardian to do your bidding?&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Well&mldr; yes!</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no medicine garden either. I wonder if it has the time compression ability or the item stasis attribute?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guang Qiu zipped back and forth, performing scans of the surroundings. It came back within a few seconds after bouncing off an unseen barrier, light a petty gray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter now?&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>It has none of the abilities that Bai Jing&rsquo;s artifact has. There&rsquo;s no special attributes to this place at all! Even the soil is normal soil!</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; Jiaojiao held the back of her hand to her forehead. &ldquo;Whatever shall we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>&mldr;are you mocking me?</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;re not completely hopeless.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>How can you joke at a time like this? This is serious! This was meant to be your replacement for Bai Jing&rsquo;s artifact and it cannot even perform the most basic function of providing medicinal ingredients! How will you become a powerful alchemist with this?!</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;So sad.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>How will you heal yourself without elixirs? You cannot cultivate at all with that worn out rag of a body! Why can&rsquo;t you be more serious?</em></p>
<p>Jiaojiao just smiled, laying her tired body out on the soft moss.</p>
<p>The ball paused, as if deep in thought. <em>&mldr;haven&rsquo;t you thought about it? What you can do with more power?</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Power?&rdquo; Jiaojiao shook her head, long dark hair tangling among the white flowers. &ldquo;Not interested.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>What if I told you you could resurrect the dead with more power?</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you warn me against that? Something about ruining the cycle of reincarnation for whoever I&rsquo;m resurrecting?&rdquo; Jiaojiao squinted. &ldquo;What changed your mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>I&rsquo;ve been thinking, perhaps I dismissed you too easily. It&rsquo;s true that you haven&rsquo;t gotten any discernible benefits from me&mldr;</em></p>
<p>Jiaojiao scoffed.</p>
<p><em>&mldr;but that can all change if we cooperate.</em></p>
<p>Jiaojiao narrowed her eyes. &ldquo;Cooperate how?&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>If you promise to do what I say, I will help you resurrect the people you want to. Up to a point! I won&rsquo;t bring back more than three. Three is the limit.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Three is enough,&rdquo; Jiaojiao said at last. &ldquo;What brought on this change?&rdquo; She held up a hand. &ldquo;You know what? I don&rsquo;t need to know. Fine. All I have to do is follow the plot?&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>If only it were that easy! After all your bumbling, it will be difficult to pull it back on track.</em></p>
<p>She rolled her eyes. &ldquo;If destiny is so powerful, why are you obsessing so much over my actions? Won&rsquo;t things end up the way they are supposed to regardless of my actions?&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Even the most powerful forces have a limit,</em> the ball said darkly. <em>And sometimes, destiny has a strange way of fixing itself. Things might happen in a fashion least desirable.</em></p>
<p>Jiaojiao found the hairs on her arms standing up and brushed her hands over her arms in annoyance. What was she getting creeped out for? It was just a damn ball.</p>
<p><em>Get up mortal, we have plans to make!</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a second,&rdquo; Jiaojiao said fuzzily, rolling on the banks of the pond. &ldquo;This is <em>so</em> soft.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Will you stop being lazy? There&rsquo;s no time for this!</em></p>
<p>Jiaojiao paused in her rolling to shoot the ball a death glare. &ldquo;Hey, just because I agreed to cooperate doesn&rsquo;t mean that I&rsquo;ve forgiven you for messing with my head. "</p>
<p><em>&mldr;will you please get up so we can work on a plan?</em> The ball asked, nonexistent teeth gritted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a min&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was an abrupt shift in scenery. Jiaojiao slammed bodily into the unforgiving wooden floors of Bai Xingyue&rsquo;s inner chambers. She coughed and rolled onto her sides, holding her butt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the hell happened?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p><em>&mldr;it seems the newly opened space is unstable and has ejected you.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;&mldr;you gave me a defective product?&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s not defective!</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Haha,&rdquo; Jiaojiao laughed sarcastically and rolled onto knees, massaging her aching backside.</p>
<p><em>&mldr;perhaps we should discuss our next plan of action?</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;What is there to discuss? Aren&rsquo;t we working for Mo Wudi now under threat of decapitation?&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>That&rsquo;s not enough! You must follow Bai Jing&rsquo;s actions in the novel as closely as possible! At this point in time, Bai Jing&rsquo;s reputation as a godly doctor should be spreading throughout the capital&mldr;</em> a disdainful pause aimed at a certain mortal. <em>Her first act that pushed her towards fame was curing the poisoned son of general Ran.</em></p>
<p>Jiaojiao located the relevant chapters from the downloaded text in her mind, then wrinkled her nose. &ldquo;Do I have to?&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>What is it now?</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;All that blood and pus, and eugh&mldr;&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Must you be so squeamish?</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy for you to say! You don&rsquo;t have to worry about bacteria or infection! Do you know how unsanitary this world is? Theres no protective equipment at all! I&rsquo;d have to go in there with a cloth mask and hope for the best that I don&rsquo;t catch syphillis or something.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>&mldr;I&rsquo;m fairly certain that the general&rsquo;s son doesn&rsquo;t have syphilis.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Fairly certain isn&rsquo;t a hundred percent though, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Would you stop quibbling? Didn&rsquo;t we agree to cooperate?</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;&mldr;<em>Fine</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Now, as I was saying&ndash;</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;What if I kill him by accident?&rdquo;</p>
<p>*Nonsense!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you forget I have no medical training? I don&rsquo;t even know CPR. I was a PR major for fucks sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Yes, I haven&rsquo;t forgotten that you are a mere entertainer. Fret not, mortal! For I am here.</em></p>
<p>Jiaojiao eyed the ball. &ldquo;You have medical training?&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Hah, can such a simple thing stump me? I am well versed in the intricacies of the human body! Don&rsquo;t underestimate me, mortal!</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. But if he dies, it&rsquo;s entirely your fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>No one is going to die!</em></p>
