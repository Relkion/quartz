<p><em>Crap, shit, fuck, piz-detz, hui.</em></p>
<p>The future husband Guang Qiu spoke of was named Mo Wudi, the titular character in <em>The Cold Prince Loves me Dearly</em>. Not only was he cold, he was an ice-cold killer. And not only was he an ice-cold killer, he was an ice-cold killer prone to sudden, inexplicably rages, notorious for lashing out at random.</p>
<p>He had two identities, one as the thirteenth prince of Languo, and the other, more mysterious identity as the masked head of the Abyss Syndicate, an organization that dominated the Jianghu.</p>
<p>More importantly, in addition to having great influence, Mo Wudi was one of the most physically jacked people in Languo, having crossed the threshold of martial master and stepped on the true threshold of immortal cultivation.</p>
<p>If Mo Wudi was considered a level 90 player, then Jiaojiao would be one of those harmless atmospheric mobs that would die with a casual poke. It was imperative that she avoid this mercurial psycho as much as possible.</p>
<p><em>What are you waiting for?</em> Guang Qiu said. <em>Go introduce yourself!</em></p>
<p>Jiaojiao ignored the ball and shuffled as rapidly as she could with her immobilized right leg. She made a sharp angle toward the counter, intent on giving the living yama a wide berth. The figure turned with her movements, the glaring demon eyes of the mask fixed upon her.</p>
<p><em>Yeah, that&rsquo;s not creepy at all.</em></p>
<p><em>Don&rsquo;t be shy, just go up and talk to him,</em> Guang Qiu coaxed, as if it were a wingman in a singles bar.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the clinic was not that spacious, and Jiaojiao was not that lucky. Her balance failed her at the worst juncture and she found herself falling toward that cold figure with almost calculated precision.</p>
<p><em>Gav-no!</em> Jiaojiao defaulted to Russian in her time of crisis.</p>
<p>As Jiaojiao fell, she had a split second to consider several possibilities. Taking Mo Wudi&rsquo;s personality as depicted in the webnovel, there were two likely outcomes. One, he would simply dodge aside and allow Jiaojiao to humiliate herself as nature intended. Or two, he would be too lazy to move and slap her dead with a contemptuous palm.</p>
<p>However, neither of these scenarios came to pass. Instead of face-planting on the clinic floor or stepping onto the naihe bridge, she found herself cradled in an unlikely pair of firm arms. Her straw hat was bumped off her head and her face smushed against a solid chest.</p>
<p>Jiaojiao couldn&rsquo;t move, frozen in pure fright. One second, two seconds, then she jerked her face as if the young man was made from scalding hot coals.</p>
<p><em>Hashtag wtf?</em> What was this shoujo manga development? Where was the crazy, murderous psychopath I was promised?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much,&rdquo; Jiaojiao said robotically as she shuffled back. &ldquo;I need to go now goodbye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She booked it, making for the front entryway as fast as she could with her immobilized leg. Are you kidding? If she didn&rsquo;t leave now when would she? What if Mo Wudi realized he&rsquo;d broken character and came after her to fix his gaffe?</p>
<p><em>Where are you going?</em> Guang Qiu said. <em>You didn&rsquo;t even say more than a few words. What a splendid first encounter! He hugged you!</em></p>
<p>The only thing missing from Guang Qiu&rsquo;s speech was a squeal of delight.</p>
<p><em>We are leaving. Now.</em></p>
<p><em>Why are you so eager to leave?</em></p>
<p><em>Didn&rsquo;t you want to go get the artifact or was that not you whining the entire morning?</em></p>
<p><em>You can ask him to go with you!</em></p>
<p><em>Guang Qiu I don&rsquo;t know if I should be amused or disgusted by your naivete. What makes you think he&rsquo;ll agree? We are nothing by passersby.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; said a deep magnetic voice.</p>
<p><em>He&rsquo;s talking to you!</em></p>
<p><em>What? I didn&rsquo;t hear anything.</em> She was almost at the door&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girl, stop.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>You must have heard that. Who else could he be talking to? Surely not Doctor Tai,</em> Guang Qiu said sarcastically.</p>
<p><em>Who are we to question Doctor Tai&rsquo;s gender identity?</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you hear the young&ndash;, I mean this gentleman?&rdquo; Doctor Tai stepped forward to catch Jiaojiao by the sleeve. &ldquo;Where do you think you&rsquo;re going in a rush? One would think your leg isn&rsquo;t broken at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does this gentleman have to do with me? Should I stop to answer every random heckler?&rdquo; Jiaojiao smiled. &ldquo;Or are you intent on harassing a young lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Doctor sneered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put on airs now. You think I didn&rsquo;t see you just now, when you practically threw yourself in this man&rsquo;s arms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we living in the same reality? I only have one leg right now. Is it so strange that I tripped? The man caught me, I thanked him, and now would like to go on with my day. Who are you people to stop me?&rdquo; Jiaojiao jerked her sleeve from Doctor Tai&rsquo;s grasp, thumping her staff for emphasis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xingyue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao froze.</p>
<p>Doctor Tai&rsquo;s eyes widened, as if he was seeing Jiaojiao for the first time. &ldquo;No wonder you&rsquo;re half dead with poison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; Jiaojiao said through gritted teeth. &ldquo;What of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The masked man, brushed off a smudge of powder from the front of his robe. &ldquo;Your makeup is shedding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nearly combusted from embarrassment. If this were her previous life on earth, being caught wearing inferior cosmetics would be a career ending snafu. &ldquo;Thank you for alerting me. Is that all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t realize we had the future empress in our humble establishment!&rdquo; Doctor Tai was sneering. &ldquo;Dianxia, thus humble servant sends his greetings!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hahahaha,&rdquo; Jiaojiao had no more fucks to give and was seriously fed up. She left no parting remark, simply leaving the doctor and the impassive Mo Wudi to whatever conversation they were having before she&rsquo;d interrupted.</p>
<p>The rickshaw puller was where she left him, she threw him another few copper coins. &ldquo;To Yixin street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao had an interesting time dragging her splinted leg into the cart while the rickshaw driver offered no help, simply taking her struggles as scenery. As the rickshaw pulled into traffic, Jiaojiao pulled the straw hat lower on her face, shading it from the noonday sun.</p>
<p><em>I still think you should have asked him to go with you.</em></p>
<p><em>Guang Qiu, why are you so sure he&rsquo;d like me?</em> Jiaojiao asked, genuinely curious. <em>After all, I am not Bai Jing. I have very little in common with him. If I read the story correctly, he liked Bai Jing because she was similar to him. After all, they could bond over the art of murder or some such. What do I have in common with that guy? Huh?</em></p>
<p><em>It doesn&rsquo;t matter! You can develop with time!</em></p>
<p><em>Not likely. Do you know how old that guy is? He&rsquo;s seventeen!</em></p>
<p><em>&mldr;and?</em></p>
<p><em>You think a seventeen year old boy and a twenty-three year old girl are a likely pair?</em></p>
<p><em>&mldr;but your body is only fifteen years old.</em></p>
<p><em>Is this the point? You think just because the body is fifteen the mind will regress?</em> Jiaojiao shook her head. It would be like a high school student dating a college graduate. She doubted she could have a single meaningful conversation with a seventeen year old, much less a whole-ass relationship. Highschool boys were closer to apes than people in her view. <em>Besides, in my world, a seventeen year old getting with a twenty-three year old is considered statutory rape.</em></p>
<p><em>This isn&rsquo;t your old world,</em> Guang Qiu argued. <em>To be unmarried at twenty-three&mldr; you would be called a spinster.</em></p>
<p>Jiaojiao glared at the ball. <em>Call me that again.</em></p>
<p><em>Don&rsquo;t get offended, it&rsquo;s true! Besides, isn&rsquo;t this a good opportunity to fix your status?</em></p>
<p><em>Why do you think being single is something to be fixed? Maybe I&rsquo;m happy being single.</em></p>
<p><em>Isn&rsquo;t this what mortals do? Get married, have babies and then die. Besides, you must form a relationship with Mo Wudi. The plot calls for it!</em></p>
<p>Jiaojiao shook her head. In the events of the webnovel, Bai Jing met and fell in love with Mo Wudi, despite a nine year age difference. Big Yikes. Put even if she could excuse that behavior as being in a gray area due to Bai Jing being in a younger body, their entire relationship dynamic made Jiaojiao uncomfortable to read. Mo Wudi was a deeply troubled young man and Bai Jing happened to fill a void in his life. It was disturbing to note that the teenager was deeply obsessed with the woman after meeting her, even abandoning many aspects of his life to please her. The novel portrayed it as a deep and moving love story, but Jiaojiao wasn&rsquo;t so sure.</p>
<p><em>That boy needs therapy, not a relationship. I don&rsquo;t have the energy or ability to fix him.</em></p>
<p>Guang Qiu grumbled but didn&rsquo;t push it. Perhaps occupied with the thought of retrieving the artifact. <em>Perhaps it&rsquo;s for the best you left when you did. You&rsquo;re not supposed to meet him for another few days anyway.</em></p>
<p>The rest of the ride passed in silence. Jiaojiao watched the sights of the city pass by, wrinkling her nose as they passed a marketplace. The babble of servants bargaining with the sellers filled her ears. Rotten vegetable leaves choked the gutters and a tanned woman wrung the neck of a squawking chicken. Jiaojiao looked on, aghast.A gaggle of painted beauties loitered in front brightly decorated storefront, beckoning to passing men. A gust of wind brought the smell of incense and perfume. Enticing smells drifted from the roadside carts, sellers calling out prices, ladling dumplings into wooden bowls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; the rickshaw driver paused on the corner of a quiet street.</p>
<p>Jiaojiao showed the rickshaw the token she&rsquo;d found in Cen Wei&rsquo;s sleeve. &ldquo;Do you know which shop this is from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rickshaw driver simply pointed to a particular shop, a it had gaudily decorated front with red lanterns and gold paint, a contrast to the other more modestly attired shops on the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like a scam,&rdquo; Jiaojiao muttered as she hauled her body off the rickshaw. She slowly made her way through the crowd, careful not to jostle her leg. Thankfully the crowd wasn&rsquo;t too dense and she only suffered a few slight bumps. As she neared the shop entrance, a girl dressed in a bright pink exited the shop, speaking sharply to the two servants flanking her.</p>
<p>Jiaojiao nearly twisted into a pretzel turning aside, hurriedly pulling the straw hat down in front of her face.</p>
<p><em>Isn&rsquo;t that&mldr;</em></p>
<p><em>Yep.</em></p>
<p>Bai Xingwu, the violent girl who&rsquo;d nearly punched into a paste the day before was somehow a patron of very the same shop Cen Wei frequently pawned things to. Who would have thought? Does this ugly shop have some destiny with the Bai Family?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mistress, you have such good taste!&rdquo; one of the servants said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This shimmering pearwood bracelet looks so pretty on your wrist! It really makes your skin glow!&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>No. No way.</em></p>
<p><em>Mortal!</em> Guang Qiu wailed in her mind. <em>That girl has the artifact!</em></p>
