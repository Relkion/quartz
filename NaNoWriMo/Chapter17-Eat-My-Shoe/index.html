<p>The next day proved Jiaojiao&rsquo;s premonition was correct. After a lazy morning, during which she and Rui Si continued producing more leather bracelets, Tu Wenfeng came back right before noon, much less excited than he had been the day before. His brows were drawn as he slowly trudged into the courtyard, dragging the rickshaw behind him. The children were wise to his moods and didn&rsquo;t crowd around him as he came before Jiaojiao.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man who bought the rest of the bracelets from me yesterday returned today with his own&mldr; imitations,&rdquo; Tu Wenfeng admitted. &ldquo;You were right, I should not have sold to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao shook her head. &ldquo;Even if you hadn&rsquo;t, he would have found a middleman to buy from you, or simply bought it off another customer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do we do? We cannot compete with him. He had three as many bracelets as I did, even the leather was dyed different colors!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a war of resources,&rdquo; Jiaojiao nodded. &ldquo;We cannot compete with pure monetary power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t this the same as specialty shops versus business giants in her past life? After all, in the interest of competing for a larger consumer base, such companies had to cut down on specialty products, generalizing large sections of their product line to make reproduction easier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Resources are limited, but creativity is endless!&rdquo; Jiaojiao smiled. Wasn&rsquo;t this precisely what she was good at? She often made her own accessories in her past life. It was easy for her to come up with new designs.</p>
<p>Besides, heh. Who did these people think they were? Dare to edge in on her budding business? Not on your life! Jiaojiao had a good understanding of herself, and of her needs. She was used to a life where money was just a number. She couldn&rsquo;t bear to continue this hand to mouth existence a second longer! And her comfortable future was directly dependent on this business venture of hers.</p>
<p>Jiaojiao tsked. &ldquo;Tutu, did you get any of the other things I asked for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tu Wenfeng shuffled awkwardly, still smarting from the smack from reality he&rsquo;d received. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t sell much today, so I bought some of the things you asked for yesterday.&rdquo; He handed Jiaojiao a parcel wrapped in a worn cloth.</p>
<p>Jiaojiao untied it and took stock with a frown. &ldquo;This is all you got?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silk is expensive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really are a miserly wretch,&rdquo; Jiaojiao scoffed. &ldquo;You expect to make money with that sort of attitude? No wonder you came home with your tail between your legs. You&rsquo;ve no business sense at all. As soon as my leg heals, I&rsquo;ll go home and you can go back to dragging that dumb cart of yours. Yanyan will thank you for being so wise with money, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao really knew where to stab Tu Wenfeng where it hurt and also pour salt on the wound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will do better next time,&rdquo; Tu Wenfeng said between gritted teeth.</p>
<p>After Chu Hua gave him a stern talking to the day before, his attitude had become more tolerant, if not more friendly.</p>
<p>Rui Si cheered, seeing the colorful array of silk cord in the parcel. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s beautiful! What are we making today, <em>da jie</em>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao tested the silk cord with her fingers. It wasn&rsquo;t as finely spun as what could be found in her past life, but it would have to do. &ldquo;We will make lucky knots,&rdquo; she looked up when Tu Wenfeng made a questioning noise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me you don&rsquo;t have them in your wor&ndash;er, this country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never heard of lucky knots. Are you a foreigner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was good news, after all, rarity determined price.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you from Ziguo, perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Where&rsquo;s Ziguo?</em> Jiaojiao asked Guang Qiu, who had been increasingly silent as of late.</p>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s a country to the south,</em> Guang Qiu answered, after a slight pause.</p>
<p><em>What have you been doing?</em> she asked it suspiciously. <em>You&rsquo;ve been awfully quiet.</em></p>
<p>Guang Qiu didn&rsquo;t answer, simply floating there like a dim ball of ill-intent.</p>
<p>She narrowed her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh, what are you looking at?&rdquo; Tu Wenfeng asked, looking like he was worrying for the sanity of his cash cow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come Rui Si,&rdquo; Jiaojiao said at last, with one last glare in Guang Qiu&rsquo;s direction, she nudged the young girl with her hip. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll teach you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rui Si cheered, walking ahead with the parcel of silk cord held in her hands like she was carrying crystal. The other children tried to get a peek at the parcel, but she held it away from them. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get them dirty!&rdquo; she complained, giving a pointed look at their grubby, mud-stained hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rui Si, you&rsquo;re still playing with that ghost-face?&rdquo; Min Tong asked, bounding to stand in front of Rui Si.</p>
<p>Rui Si&rsquo;s eyes narrowed above her veil. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call her that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ghost-face! Ghost-face!&rdquo; Min Tong taunted.</p>
<p>Rui Si gave a frustrated growl and dodged to the side. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting in the way! We&rsquo;re going to make money!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stupid!&rdquo; Min Tong sneered. &ldquo;What kind of money can two women make anyway!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Jiaojiao hobbled after Rui Si and tapped her staff on the ground. &ldquo;Why are you stopping to argue with irrelevant people? Just ignore him. We have a lot to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rui Si sniffed and walked around the red-faced Min Tong. &ldquo;Sorry, some people are just too annoying! Good dogs don&rsquo;t block the road!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other children laughed, but quickly stifled it with their hands when Min Tong turned to them with his fist raised. &ldquo;Be quiet! I&rsquo;m not a dog! I&rsquo;m going to become an immortal!&rdquo; he pointed a finger at Jiaojiao, &ldquo;the first thing I&rsquo;ll do is seal you away! Ugly ghost-face!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ghost-face! Ghost-face!&rdquo; some children echoed, some even bending over to scoop mud off the ground.</p>
<p>Jiaojiao turned to Tu Wenfeng. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to let them treat your money tree like this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tu Wenfeng coughed. &ldquo;All right, that&rsquo;s enough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The children groaned, but threw down their handfuls of mud. The most easily distracted among them bit their lips and wandered off to find other amusements. Min Tong turned purple.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I&rsquo;m so scared, o' great immortal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rui Si laughed so hard she bent in two, &ldquo;great immortal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later that evening, Min Tong got his revenge when he sat down to a meal of fluffy white rice and pickled vegetables, a great luxury for the children of the temple. Jiaojiao frowned at the wilted vegetables and watery millet the other children and she were forced to choke down.</p>
<p>Min Tong made a great show of blowing on the steaming white rice, lightly scooping a mouthful with a pair of bamboo chopsticks, he placed the morsel in his mouth, then panted when it burned his tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Delicious!&rdquo; he announced with a groan of satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does it taste like?&rdquo; a hollow-cheeked child asked, squeezing so close he was nearly sitting in Min Tong&rsquo;s lap.</p>
<p>Min Tong leaned away with a disgusted look. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t breathe in my face!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just wanted to get a smell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao could only watch this scene with a mixture of bafflement and discomfort. The rice was only the most inferior broken rice, with particles of hulls mixed in. She wouldn&rsquo;t have eaten such fare even if you paid her to in her last life, but it was enough to send these kids scrambling for a mere sniff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Granny Hua really knows how to play favorites.&rdquo; Jiaojiao smirked around the rim of her bowl as she swallowed down the tasteless dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So what if you can make money, ghost face?&rdquo; Min Tong said, placing down his chopsticks with a bang. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I still eat better than you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Idiot who doesn&rsquo;t know the world,&rdquo; Jiaojiao tapped the table with her own chopsticks. &ldquo;You would think you are eating an imperial banquet from the way you talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other children giggled into their sleeves at Min Tong&rsquo;s purple face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you know?&rdquo; Min Tong snapped. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve eaten a single mouthful of white rice in your life, I&rsquo;ll&ndash;I&rsquo;ll eat my shoe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao smacked the table. &ldquo;You said it! Don&rsquo;t you forget!</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tutu!&rdquo; Jiaojiao called, snapping her fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; he frowned at Jiaojiao form over his own bowl of millet gruel, though his bowl was many times larger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much does rice cost in the capital? And I don&rsquo;t mean the garbage the <em>immortal</em> over there is eating, I mean the good stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tu Wenfeng didn&rsquo;t seem to like where the conversation was going. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just tell me, you miser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Its 2 silver per <em>shi</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then buy two <em>shi</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao slammed her hand on the table. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t tell you what to do with the money you earn yourself, but damned if I have to work while eating this&mldr;&rdquo; she flicked her half-empty bowl. &ldquo;<em>food</em>, though I use that term loosely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tu Wenfeng bit at air. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need a whole <em>shi</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you still arguing with me?&rdquo; Jiaojiao was amazed. &ldquo;Do you really not understand what I&rsquo;m saying? You want me to work, but don&rsquo;t let me eat? What kind of person are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You still don&rsquo;t need a whole <em>shi</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do these children not exist to you?&rdquo; Jiaojiao laughed. &ldquo;What kind of place is this anyway? One eats white rice, the other eats wind. Quite interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tu Wenfeng finally shut up and bent over his bowl, clenching his chopsticks with a trembling fist. Chu Hua followed the conversation from the far end of the table like a ping-pong match, but said nothing. Small mercies.</p>
<p>Some of the smarter children followed the conversation and were now talking animatedly among themselves. Min Tong had turned the color of eggplant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will we really have rice to eat?&rdquo; Rui Si asked Jiaojiao in a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Tutu can follow simple directions, then yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rui Si&rsquo;s eyes crinkled, her wide smile hidden under her veil.</p>
<p>After dinner, the two girls made more corded bracelets with silk and leather, Rui Si once again proving a quick study to knotwork and braiding. They retired late at night, when their eyes ached from squinting in the low light offered by the single candle Chu Hua generously afforded them.</p>
<p>The next day, Tu Wenfeng rose before dawn and was long gone by the time Jiaojiao rose from slumber and hobbled her way to morning meal. The children had wisely not thrown mud at her that morning, those smart ones already regretting their past actions, the ones that had taken action anyway. Of the twenty-three children in the temple, Jiaojiao remembered very well that only seven had the temerity to sling mud.</p>
<p>A fact that she demonstrated aptly when Tu Wenfeng returned in the afternoon, stoked with success, two bags of rice in his rickshaw.</p>
<p>That night, Jiaojiao delicately tasted the rice and pickled vegetables in her bowl while the other children, except a specific seven, dove into their meal like starving rats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Min Tong,&rdquo; she said slowly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m waiting for you to eat your shoe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This prompted three children to laugh so abruptly they nearly choked on their rice. Rui Si was shaking so hard she almost dropped her bowl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; Min Tong jumped up, throwing down his chopsticks. &ldquo;Shut up you, ghost-face! "</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? Is the great immortal not going to honor his words?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Min Tong screamed almost threw himself across the table, but Tu Wenfeng caught the back of his shirt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go outside,&rdquo; he barked at the flailing Min Tong. &ldquo;Why are you making a scene? Do real men argue with women?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Min Tong gasped, angry tears gleaming in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hehe, spoken like a true man who can&rsquo;t win an argument.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They boy bit back his words, then pushed Tu Wenfeng&rsquo;s hand away to rush outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you target the boy?&rdquo; Tu Wenfeng asked with a disappointed look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, should I let him throw mud and call me names? Is that how a <em>virtuous lady</em> conducts herself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tu Wenfeng frowned, as if unable to answer the question. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao took another bite of her rice. &ldquo;What made you think I was virtuous?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night, Jiaojiao was settling down for bed when she overheard a conversation in the hallway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rui Si, you really aren&rsquo;t going to listen to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I listen to you? You&rsquo;re nothing but a bully who doesn&rsquo;t honor his words!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t really mean it when I said I would eat my shoe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not talking about that! I&rsquo;m talking about&ndash;&rdquo; Rui Si scoffed. &ldquo;Nevermind, what&rsquo;s the use of saying this now? That big sister is already dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao edged as quietly as she could to peek around the doorframe. In the low light of the moon, two children stood opposite each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why else would she be so scared? She was so kind, she gave you her purse, but you didn&rsquo;t listen to her at all! You told that awful man&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you talking about this now?&rdquo; Min Tong asked in a sharp whisper. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been almost a year!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think I would forget something like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should! I have!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think I don&rsquo;t know where Granny Hua got the silver for your rice? If anyone should remember that girl, it should be you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that ghost face is just putting ideas in your head!&rdquo; Min Tong growled. He stepped forward and snatched Rui Si&rsquo;s wrist. &ldquo;Is this what she gave you? Is this what she made?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Rui Si wrist was a charming pink bracelet with knots like flowers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let go of me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s filling your head with lies!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao knocked her staff on the wall, like ducks starting from a gunshot, the two kids leapt apart and stared at her, eyes wild.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you standing out here, arguing in the middle of the night?&rdquo; Jiaojiao complained. &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you have clandestine conversations in the daylight when it won&rsquo;t interrupt my sleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big Sis!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ghost!&rdquo; Min Tong cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Idiot, have you peed yourself again? Granny Hua will cry.&rdquo;</p>
