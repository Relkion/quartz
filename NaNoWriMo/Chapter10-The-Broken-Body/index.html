<p>Jiaojiao sat there, a healthy amount of skepticism making itself known by her unenthused expression as the doctor felt her pulse at her wrist. He had placed a handkerchief between their hands, because <em>propriety</em>. Jiaojiao couldn&rsquo;t spare the energy to ridicule this excessive need for distance between the sexes. By what she&rsquo;d gathered from the text, the physicians in this world had the ability to diagnose patients just by feeling their pulse. Bai Jing herself was an expert at this technique, demonstrated over and over by her various encounters with ill people, always with some affliction that left lesser doctors scratching their heads. These people, usually of rich and affluent backgrounds, were always left impressed by such a young doctor, showering her with accolades and favors. Even Doctor Tai, the man currently diagnosing her and a famous doctor in his own right, (though he was currently going through a rough patch) had been left awestruck, going so far as to call her <em>shifu.</em></p>
<p><em>Indeed, the plot has been bent out of shape,</em> Guang Qiu lamented in her mind. <em>This disciple has been lost.</em></p>
<p>Jiaojiao&rsquo;s mind wandered as the doctor furrowed his brow, concentrating on her pulse. She kept a paranoid eye on the outer area, lost in thought. <em>The text is a bit vague on this, but if what it says here is true, he should be in the palace for another few days.</em></p>
<p><em>What was that mortal?</em></p>
<p><em>Nothing.</em></p>
<p>Doctor Tai&rsquo;s eyes finally opened, shooting her an odd, scrunched look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she asked, when he continued to stare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;How are you even alive?&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>That&rsquo;s a really good question.</em> Jiaojiao almost laughed out loud. <em>Guang Qiu, do you think this guy is a psychic?</em></p>
<p><em>Nonsense, there&rsquo;s nothing special about this mortal. Even his medical skills are only so-so&ndash;</em> Guang Qiu said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have two different poisons running through you,&rdquo; Doctor Tai said haltingly, as if parsing a very difficult math problem. &ldquo;Either one should be enough to kill you, but to have both&ndash;&rdquo; a sharp look, &ldquo;&ndash;just who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Cough, I suppose his skills aren&rsquo;t bad for such a backward realm,</em> Guang Qiu amended.</p>
<p><em>There&rsquo;s two poisons?</em> Jiaojiao said incredulously. <em>Just how much does Head Wife Zhang hate this girl?</em></p>
<p>Guang Qiu tsked in a rare moment of accord. <em>She is indeed a poisonous shrew.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;I see your face has traces of powder. Is there perhaps a red mark on your face? Are perhaps also a martial cripp&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this relevant?&rdquo; Jiaojiao deflected the man&rsquo;s peaking professional interest. &ldquo;I just came here to get my leg looked at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a doctor,&rdquo; the man repeated, as if Jiaojiao were likely to forget, &ldquo;I take my job very seriously. You can&rsquo;t just ask me to ignore an aspect of my patient&rsquo;s health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this patient is asking you to ignore it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just who is it that has the money here?&rdquo; Jiaoajiao gripped her staff as if she were ready to stand. &ldquo;Shall I take my business elsewhere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Doctor Tai bit out. &ldquo;Keep your secrets. Roll up your pants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao did so with difficulty, her right leg numb and unresponsive from her morning journey.</p>
<p>The man paused, taking in the horrific mess of old scar tissue and knotted flesh with clinical eyes. He draped the handkerchief over the old crooked break in the calf and began to poke and prod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like a compound fracture, both tibia and fibula snapped. A clean break, but left untreated and complicated with infection. I&rsquo;m surprised the leg hasn&rsquo;t rotten off your body. How old is this? About five years?&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>How should I know?</em> Jiaojiao complained. The book hadn&rsquo;t included many details on how or when Bai Xingyue had broken her leg, only stating that that her dear father had done the breaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be easier to look at without the cloth?&rdquo; She asked instead of answering.</p>
<p>The man shot her an affronted look. &ldquo;I am a gentleman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao gave up. She would never understand the exaggerated modesty of the ancients.</p>
<p>After what seemed like an hour, the doctor stood, wiping his hands even though they&rsquo;d never touched flesh. &ldquo;I can reset the leg, but I can&rsquo;t promise you that you&rsquo;ll be able to walk any straighter afterward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao squinted. &ldquo;How much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifty&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to try that again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He glowered. &ldquo;Twenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifteen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twelve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirteen! My final offer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done.&rdquo; Jiaojiao said.</p>
<p>Having reached a deal, the doctor instructed her to lay flat on the platform, then handed her a wooden dowel about three fingers thick and a foot long. She took it with a puzzled glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you don&rsquo;t bite yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What the hell? &ldquo;What about anesthesia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unavailable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao had never stood faster in her life, gimp leg or no. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll find another doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you seriously thing you&rsquo;d be able to find another willing to help you? Remember the poison you have running through your veins? They&rsquo;ll take one look and decide they won&rsquo;t want to mess with anyone who has enemies powerful enough to afford heartbreak ganoderma <em>and</em> meridian shattering grass,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao stopped, half sitting, half crouching. &ldquo;But it will hurt.&rdquo; She whined.</p>
<p><em>Stop whinging, mortal. You&rsquo;re wasting time.</em> Guang Qiu interjected.</p>
<p><em>Well, excuse me for my hesitation! What a coward I am, not wanting to have my leg broken without anesthesia!</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry up,&rdquo; the doctor urged, seemingly in concert with the unseen and unheard Guang Qiu. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have all day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao bit back a sarcastic quip about the doctor&rsquo;s busy clinic. It wouldn&rsquo;t do to piss off the man about to break your leg.</p>
<p>Finally, slowly, heart beating a nervous staccato in her chest, Jiaojiao lay back and placed the wooden rod between her lips. The doctor had reappeared with a wooden mallet. She squeezed her eyes shut.</p>
<p>She felt a firm grip holding down her right leg then, a huge force impacted her leg with a horrific crack, accompanied by a screaming of panicked nerves telling her, <em>yes indeed, your leg has been broken. Why did you agree to this, you</em> collassal <em>idiot?</em></p>
<p>Jiaojiao squeezed her eyes shut tight, tears trickling into her temples as she bit down hard on the dowel. She twisted, groaning in pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold still,&rdquo; the doctor said, voice almost bored. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m setting the bone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao felt a great pressure on her leg as the doctor pulled the leg straight. She had thought the worst of the pain was over but she was greatly mistaken. She could not help the unholy shriek that burst from her. The doctor set the bone, reinforcing it with two rods, cousins to the one currently creaking in distress between her jaws. He then bound it with strips of rough hemp cloth, pulling it taut against her leg.</p>
<p>Then the dowel was taken from her lips. Jiaojiao opened her eyes in time to see a round brown object stuffed into her mouth. It was terribly bitter and broke into a mess of powder the moment it hit her tongue. A riot of conflicting flavors, all terrible, invaded her tastebuds. She nearly spat it out, but the doctor glared at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swallow it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao choked down the herbal powder with difficulty. &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Medicine to heal your leg, or did you think the thirteen taels was the price of breaking a bone?&rdquo; The doctor laughed sarcastically. &ldquo;Even I&rsquo;m not that shameless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So you <em>are</em> self aware, Jiaojiao thought, then closed her eyes again, unable to have a meaningful discourse with her leg radiating monstrous pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your leg will be strong enough to walk on after a week of healing, but I&rsquo;d advise against running, jumping or heavy lifting. Try not to exert too much stress on it. Keep off your feet as much as possible,&rdquo; a pause, &ldquo;not that it matters much. With that poison in you, I doubt you&rsquo;ll live more than a few months.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Great bedside manner, doc. Five stars.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;You have half a shichen to recuperate. Then I&rsquo;m kicking you out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Retreating footsteps, then the sound of a door slamming shut.</p>
<p><em>Mortal?</em></p>
<p><em>Shut up Guang Qiu. The artifact can affort to wait until I&rsquo;m not a writhing mess of pain.</em></p>
<p>There was a dissatisfied silence, but the ball didn&rsquo;t speak again.</p>
<p>Jiaojiao drifted, half insensible with pain, for what seemed like days. It took all her willpower not to scream out and make a fool of herself, but the thought of the doctor&rsquo;s sarcastic smile gave her a dose of strength. Thankfully, the doctor&rsquo;s medicine was not just a sugar pill, and the soon pain died down to manageable levels. Jiaojiao sat up, wiping the tears from her eyes. It was without question that the layer of powder had been half ruined by her pain-induced weeping.</p>
<p>She took a look around, but there was no reflective surface she could use to inspect herself. She placed the straw hat on her head again, hoping it would be enough to obscure her features. Gingerly, she lowered her left leg down off the platform, then much more carefully, her right. Jiaojiao leaned heavily on her staff and shuffled toward the door, nearly falling over several times. It was the best Jiaojiao could expect in this era before plaster casts and aluminum crutches.</p>
<p>She made it past the partition between the front and back sections of the clinic when she heard a deep, magnetic voice. A terrible premonition came to her, stopping her in her tracks. Unable to bring herself to move forward, she began inching backward.</p>
<p><em>What do you think you&rsquo;re doing, mortal? Stop wasting time!</em></p>
<p>Shit. Shit. Jiaojiao was repeating to herself in an endless litany. I hope that isn&rsquo;t who I think it is.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You there! Girl! Are you done taking up space in my clinic?&rdquo; The doctor came after her shrinking form. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re able to walk about then it&rsquo;s time for you to pay up and leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t happen to have a back entrance in this place, would you?&rdquo; Jiaojiao asked.</p>
<p>The doctor gave her a strange look. &ldquo;Yes&mldr; why do you ask? Nevermind, just give me the money and get out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao slapped the silver taels into his hand and gave him an angry smile. &ldquo;Take me out the back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Why are you still here? Just go! We don&rsquo;t have time for this!</em> Guang Qiu said.</p>
<p>Jiaojiao summoned all her dwindling patience. &ldquo;<em>Fine.</em>&rdquo; And began the arduous journey out the front of the clinic, hoping her premonition wasn&rsquo;t accurate. Please don&rsquo;t let it be <em>that guy.</em></p>
<p>Her pleas to the universe went unheeded. A tall figure with fine black embroidered robes stood in the dusty waiting area, a white porcelain mask over his face. He raised his head to look in her direction as she shuffled closer, radiating a cold and ferocious aura.</p>
<p>Jiaojiao stopped, frozen in dread. <em>Why the fuck is it him?</em></p>
<p><em>Mortal! Mortal!</em> Guang Qiu said, sounding like Christmas had come early. <em>Look! It&rsquo;s him! Your future husband!</em></p>
