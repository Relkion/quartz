Oppressive and somehow, sullen.</p><p><em>How did you know?</em> A voice asked sourly in her head. It was an ambiguous voice with a distinct lack of defining characteristics, neither male nor female and neither young or old.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you think you were being subtle with the buzzing and humming?&rdquo; Jiaojiao scoffed, scanning the room for the disembodied voice. &ldquo;It was like having a silenced phone go off directly by my ear. Where are you anyway?&rdquo;</p><p>A dim cloud of light, about the size of two fists popped into existence directly in front of Jiaojiao. She eyed it curiously. This was the the source of infernal buzzing?</p><p>&ldquo;Who are you? What the hell is going on?&rdquo;</p><p><em>Who I am is none of your concern.</em></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d say that&rsquo;s a sizzling hot take given that you&rsquo;re a hundred percent responsible for&ndash;&rdquo; she gestured at her current body.</p><p>The ball of light gave a disdainful buzz. <em>You&rsquo;re not required to know.</em></p><p><em>Wow.</em> &ldquo;You got a name?&rdquo;</p><p>There came a prickling feeling from the cloud of light that Jiaojiao translated as irritation. <em>That&rsquo;s not important. What is important is that you were a disgrace just now. Why did you kowtow?</em></p><p>&ldquo;And what was the alternative? Let her squash me like a rice cake?&rdquo;</p><p><em>You could have fought back,</em> the ball of light grumbled. <em>You should&ndash; what are you doing?!</em></p><p>Jiaojiao tsked as her hand closed around nothing, the ball of light darting away from her grasping fingers.</p><p><em>How ill-mannered!</em> The ball scolded. <em>Keep your hands to yourself!</em></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d say you&rsquo;ve gone way beyond the boundaries of rudeness when you whisked my&ndash; what? Soul? Into this place.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Can you be compared to me, puny mortal?</em></p><p>&ldquo;Puny mortal? Oh, it&rsquo;s like that is it?&rdquo; Jiaojiao smiled thinly. &ldquo;What does that make you, a god?&rdquo;</p><p><em>I may as well be a god!</em></p><p>&ldquo;Well, forgive me my impudence, oh <em>god</em>.&rdquo;</p><p>A grudging hum. <em>You are forgiven, mortal. I myself made an error in judgement. I should not have put much expectation in your decorum in the first place given your&mldr; occupation.</em></p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p><p><em>You are after all&ndash;</em> a delicate pause <em>&ndash;an entertainer.</em></p><p>&ldquo;Entertain&ndash; what?&rdquo;</p><p><em>And entertainers are not known for their refined behavior.</em></p><p>Jiaojiao eyed the ball of light in thought. It seemed, the thing, god or whatever, had a superficial understanding of her, and an even worse understanding of the world she came from. And his sensibilities were downright ancient.</p><p>&ldquo;What makes you think I&rsquo;m an entertainer?&rdquo; she asked.</p><p><em>What else would you call what you do? You display yourself for the amusement of others. Is this not the definition of an entertainer? A lowly occupation with no meaningful worth to society?</em></p><p>&ldquo;Christ, who are you, my mother?&rdquo;</p><p><em>But we seem to have ventured onto a tangental thread of conversation. We were discussing&ndash;what are you doing now?!</em></p><p>Jiaojiao ignored the ball and lifted the hem of her frayed robes and rolled up her pants to look at that damned right leg that had been troubling her. A knotted expanse of scar tissue and a crooked calf met her horrified gaze. She silently dropped the hem of her robe. <em>Not my body, not my problem.</em></p><p><em>See this is exactly what I meant! No lady-like bearing at all! Baring your flesh for all the world to see!</em></p><p>&ldquo;The world isn&rsquo;t in here. Just you,&rdquo; Jiaojiao said. &ldquo;And besides, shouldn&rsquo;t it be you who is in the wrong for being in a young girl&rsquo;s boudoir?&rdquo;</p><p><em>As I was saying,</em> the ball&rsquo;s light pulsed with rage, <em>you have a lot to answer for, you disgraceful harlot.</em></p><p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t hold back on my account. Tell me what you really think.&rdquo;</p><p><em>You bowed and scraped like a beggar. Have you seen yourself?</em></p><p>&ldquo;No actually,&rdquo; Jiaojiao answered. &ldquo;I can say with all honesty I have never seen myself.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Well, you are an absolute shame to behold! I am embarrassed on your behalf! Did you really have to kowtow?</em> the ball of light continued. <em>If you could have just&ndash;</em></p><p>&ldquo;Fought back?&rdquo; she pointed at her leg. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen the leg. This body is basically crippled.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Bai Jing did it, and she had the same leg. She fought Bai Xingwu and won. That&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s supposed to go. Bai Xingwu and her two servants retreat in terror after losing to Bai Jing in a three on one fight.</em> The ball of light paused, and a heavy sense of oppression emanated from it. <em>At least, that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s supposed to go.</em></p><p>Jiaojiao smiled a smile that wasn&rsquo;t a smile. &ldquo;Say, are you confused about something? What do those three have to do with me? Why should any of this have anything to do with me? You and I both know that I&rsquo;m not this Bai Jing person.&rdquo;</p><p>A heavy pause. The light flickered like a staticky TV.</p><p><em>Interesting.</em> The it finally said. <em>Most people would hesitate before admitting they weren&rsquo;t the person meant to be here. After all, you just died and it can be surmised that I&rsquo;m the sole reason you still live and breathe&mldr;</em>*</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, yes, you are very mighty, very powerful, I am very impress,&rdquo; Jiaojiao waved a hand. &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that I am not Bai Jing and you can&rsquo;t expect me to behave like her.&rdquo;</p><p><em>You don&rsquo;t have a choice. You have already died. The person you were no longer exists. If you cannot be Bai Jing then there is no use for you at all.</em></p><p>Jiaojiao wrinkled her nose then took a sniff of her shoulder, having been nagged by the faint smell of mildew ever since waking. She got a whiff of stagnant water and algae. A tell-tale patch of green on her sleeve drew her attention. Well, that angry little girl had said something about a near drowning. A completed drowning? After all, <em>she</em> was here.</p><p><em>It should be obvious that I hold your very life and death in my hands&mldr;</em></p><p>Jiaojiao sidestepped the ball and hobbled over to the battered armoire taking a hold of the ornated bronze handles, green with oxidation. When a firm tug left the doors unbudging, she leveraged all eighty-five pounds of her new body to wrench it open. Her arms ached with the strain and the nerves in her bum leg screamed in protest. The doors stuck on each other, swollen with age and moisture. A glance overhead revealed a patch of missing roof tiles, repaired haphazardly with a few handfuls of thatch and straw twine.</p><p>Inside the armoire was a collection of worn and aged clothing, moth-eaten silk and frayed cotton in various washed out colors. Jiaojiao paused. Did she really have to don these&mldr; these <em>rags</em>?</p><p><em>If you want to continue living, you will do well to follow my instructions&mldr; are you listening to me?</em></p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I am very invested in this conversation. Do continue.&rdquo;</p><p><em>You are dead.</em></p><p>&ldquo;Uh huh.&rdquo;</p><p><em>&mldr; shouldn&rsquo;t you be more upset?</em></p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Jiaojiao rifled through the meager selection of <em>hanfu</em>. &ldquo;Should I be weeping and wailing? Groveling at your feet for absolution?&rdquo;</p><p><em>It would be the expected reaction.</em></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m already dead, what&rsquo;s to be done?'&rdquo; Jiaojiao said. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t waste my time begging you for something you won&rsquo;t change. After all, if you were truly kind, you would have revived me in my own body instead of casting me as this Bai Jing person.&rdquo;</p><p>A hum of grudging agreement came from the ball. <em>I brought you here for a purpose.</em></p><p>JIaojiao chose one of the least ratty robes and pulled it from the armoire. &ldquo;Avert your virgin eyes, o' god, for this filthy mortal entertainer is about to disrobe.&rdquo;</p><p>The ball gave a disgusted snarl and zipped to hide behind the armoire door. <em>Have you heard a single word I&rsquo;ve said? Must you do that now?</em></p><p>&ldquo;Dead mortal, alive on your grace, here for a mission. I&rsquo;m all ears. And yes, I&rsquo;m reeking of pond scum, and I simply cannot stand it a second longer.&rdquo;</p><p><em>&mldr;as I was saying, your only purpose here is to take the place of Bai Jing.</em></p><p>&ldquo;What happened to her anyway?&rdquo; Jiaojiao asked as she shucked the damp robe from her body. It was of noticeably finer make and she would have preferred wearing it to the beggars garment she was shortly about to don were it not foul with pond water.</p><p>The ball of light paused, as if loathe to disclose an iota more information than absolutely necessary. <em>She failed the appear at the correct time. We were forced to take drastic measures to ensure the continuity of this fateline.</em></p><p>Jiaojiao&rsquo;s eyes flashed as she bowed her head to tie the belt on her clean robe. <em>Fate-line? Does that have something to do with that box of text I just saw?</em> &ldquo;So I have her to thank for this second life?&rdquo;</p><p><em>You have <strong>me</strong> to thank for this second life.</em></p><p>&ldquo;Sure boss, whatever you say.&rdquo;</p><p><em>I&rsquo;m glad you understand your position. Just do as you&rsquo;re told and all will be well.</em></p><p>&ldquo;What happens if I don&rsquo;t do as I&rsquo;m told?&rdquo;</p><p>The ball of light floated in front of Jiaojiao. A palpable oppression prickled at her skin as the light burst in intensity, bright stripes strobed across its surface. <em>Then I&rsquo;ll get rid of you and find a more obedient replacement.</em></p><p>Jiaojiao shivered, then smiled thinly. &ldquo;Got it.&rdquo;</p><p>The ball seemed satisfied with her response, withdrawing out of arms reach and the light dimmed to less blinding levels.</p><p>&ldquo;So what do I have to do?&rdquo;</p><p>The light began to strobe again. <em>Hold still, this will only hurt a bit.</em></p><p>The world exploded into light.</p><p>Jiaojiao eyes stung as the light hit her eyes, she lifted an arm to shield herself, but it didn&rsquo;t seem to make a difference. The it was like the light was piercing straight past her flesh and directly impacting her brain tissue. The beginnings of a migraine began to make itself known as dense blocks of text scrolled past her vision at an accelerated pace. Even as Jiaojiao thought that this was far too fast for anyone to read, the information seared itself into her mind as though it was being directly funneled into her synapses.</p><p><em>Bai Jing stood at the cliffside with her lover Fei Chen. The distant sunset gave a romantic backdrop to their rendevous.</em></p><p>*&ldquo;Fel Chen, it has been almost ten years since we made that promise.&rdquo;</p><p><em>&ldquo;I remember&mldr;"</em></p><p><em>&ldquo;We can leave everything behind now&mldr;"</em></p><p><em>Fei Chen embraced Bai Jing, smiling down at his beautiful fiance. Bai Jing smiled and turned her face upwards to receive his fiery kiss&mldr;</em></p><p><em>Bai Jing gasped, the pulled back at a sudden sharp pain on her chest. Right over her heart pierced a dagger. A brilliant blood-red flower bloomed&mldr;</em></p><p><em>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she asked the sinisterly smiling Fei Chen.</em></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never loved you, Bai Jing? Who would love a coarse mercenary like you? My true love is your half-sister! I was only after the inheritance your mother left you!&rdquo;</p><p><em>Fei Chen snatched the embroidered pouch from Bai Jing&rsquo;s chilled fingers.</em></p><p><em>&ldquo;Fei Chen, you better pray I don&rsquo;t live, or I&rsquo;ll make you sorry&mldr;"</em></p><p><em>Bai Jing plunged from the cliff&mldr;</em></p><p>Jiaojiao could only stand, transfixed as more text scrolled past her vision. She screwed her eyes shut, but nothing could stop the information pouring into her mind. Dear lord this is torture.</p><p><em>Bai Jing awoke in an ancient bedroom&mldr;</em></p><p><em>Bai Jing spoke to the reflection in the bronze mirror. &ldquo;Fate has given me a second chance, I won&rsquo;t let your sacrifice go to waste. I will avenge all your grievamces and punish all those who drove you to your death!""</em></p><p><em>Bai Jing kicked Bai Xingwu across the room&mldr;</em></p><p><em>Bai Jing smiled&mldr;</em></p><p><em>Bai Jing laughed&mldr;</em></p><p><em>Bai Jing sneered&mldr;</em></p><p>Jiaojiao felt like she was going crazy. On and on it went until finally the text slowed to a crawl before disappearing with a faint pop. She opened her eyes and gave the ball of light a dirty look.</p><p><em>Well?</em> The ball of light said impatiently, <em>Did you get all of it?</em></p><p>Jiaojiao gave a mirthless chuckle. &ldquo;Oh I got it. There&rsquo;s just one little problem.&rdquo;</p><p><em>What is it?</em></p><p>&ldquo;Are you kidding? You made it sound like some grand mission but I can&rsquo;t do this,&rdquo; JIaojiao shook her head. &ldquo;Nope. I can&rsquo;t help you.&rdquo;</p><p><em>I don&rsquo;t follow.</em></p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need a heroine! You need an editor! Nothing less will save us from this crappy webnovel!&rdquo;</p></article><hr><div class=page-end><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://relkion.github.io/quartz/js/graph.8aaeaccdaf2f67fa56e0d3e2d059ed5e.js></script><script>drawGraph("https://relkion.github.io/quartz/NaNoWriMo/Chapter02-The-Missing-Heroine","https://relkion.github.io/quartz",[{"/moc":"#4388cc"},{"/NaNoWriMo":"#4f43a3"}],-1,!0,!1,!0)</script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Relkion using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, ¬© 2022</p><a href=/>Home</a>
