<p>&ldquo;Wait, young miss,&rdquo; a voice came from inside the pawnshop.</p>
<p>Jiaojiao found a shadowed alley to her left and made a slow retreat toward it as Bai Xingwu turned to confront the man calling after her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; she asked haughtily, chin raised to the sky.</p>
<p>A man wearing a festive red shop uniform came into view with a chagrined expression. &ldquo;There has been a mistake, that bracelet isn&rsquo;t for sale as the default period has not passed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean? I paid money for it. It&rsquo;s mine now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man bowed his head, &ldquo;I apologize, but it really isn&rsquo;t for sale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know who I am?!&rdquo; Bai Xingwu stomped her foot.</p>
<p>Jiaojiao nearly laughed. <em>Next, she&rsquo;ll ask if they know who her father is.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know who my father is?!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time Jiaojiao had to choke down a chuckle. If that girl heard her who knows what would happen next.</p>
<p><em>Is this a laughing matter?</em> Guang Qiu berated. <em>The artifact is about to be taken away for good!</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss, that bracelet came into our shop just yesterday. It is standard policy not to sell anything that hasn&rsquo;t passed a month of waiting time. This is to give the customer time to redeem their property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of shop doesn&rsquo;t sell the things on display?&rdquo; Bai Xingwu mocked.</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s nose was nearly touching his knees with how low he was bowing, face nearly as red as his uniform. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why it was on display, but the records indeed show that the bracelet isn&rsquo;t currently for sale. If you would come back inside, we would be happy to provide a seventy percent discount on your next purchase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What nonsense! My father will have this place closed down for this insolence! Do you think the Bai Family is some soft persimmon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait! Wait!&rdquo; came a second, shrill voice from the shop as a tall, skinny man with a pointed beard rushed out. &ldquo;Ji Xin, you dare make a fool of yourself here?! How could you treat a valued customer like this?!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry miss,&rdquo; the skinny man similarly bowed to Bai Xingwu. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind anything this idiot says, he&rsquo;s merely worker here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmmph!&rdquo; Bai Xingwu turned up her nose. &ldquo;See if I dare shop here again! What rudeness! You will be sure my father will be hearing about this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, we wouldn&rsquo;t dare slight the Bai family,&rdquo; the man panicked, reaching into his sleeve, he presented a red slip of bamboo to Bai Xingwu with both hands. &ldquo;Please, take this voucher. Your next purchase will be entirely free!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sniffed and delicately took the slip with two fingers. &ldquo;At least someone in this awful place knows how to conduct themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without another word, she turned to leave, her two servants showing the pair of men the whites of their eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who do they think their are, speaking that way to the young miss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmmph, it would serve them right if they get shut down. What a bunch of cheats,&rdquo; the servant fished a bamboo whistle from her sleeve and blew three sharp notes on it.</p>
<p>A fine carriage with the Bai family standard painted on its side glided into view, drawn by two handsome white steeds. Bai Xingwu stepped inside, assisted by her two servants. With a tap of a horsewhip, the coachman drew away, blowing a cloud of dust onto the two men who had yet to rise from their bow. Jiaojiao couldn&rsquo;t say she was very fond of the young girl, but she had to admit she had <em>style</em>.</p>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s over,</em> Guang Qiu lamented. <em>What do we do now?</em></p>
<p><em>So dramatic.</em></p>
<p><em>Mortal, you don&rsquo;t understand how important that artifact is,</em> Guang Qiu said, with a heretofore absent measure of patience.</p>
<p><em>I do. Without it, I doubt Bai Jing could have accomplished even half of what she did in the book. But so what?</em></p>
<p><em>What do you mean,</em> so what?</p>
<p><em>You seem to be laboring under the impression that the things Bai Jing wanted and the things I want are one and the same,</em> Jiaojiao gave Guang Qiu a smile. <em>Would you believe me if I told you I want nothing to do with that bracelet? I would be happy if that thing never appeared in front of me again.</em></p>
<p><em>I don&rsquo;t believe you,</em> Guang Qiu sneered. <em>A mortal&rsquo;s lust for power is endless. You expect me to believe you don&rsquo;t covet eternal youth and beauty? Knowing how vain you are, I&rsquo;m surprised you haven&rsquo;t gone insane stuck in that body with that ugly face.</em></p>
<p>Jiaojiao&rsquo;s smile didn&rsquo;t fade. <em>Guang Qiu, you saw my body when you picked me up, right? Do you admit that it was very beautiful?</em></p>
<p><em>I don&rsquo;t pay attention to these things.</em></p>
<p><em>Well, that body is the only one I acknowledge as mine.</em> Jiaojiao observed a moment of poignant silence. <em>Anyway, what difference does it make if I&rsquo;m stuck in a different body? I don&rsquo;t have any connection to the people in this world. How they see this body, I don&rsquo;t care at all.</em></p>
<p><em>But this is your life!</em></p>
<p>Jiaojiao gave Guang Qiu a funny look. <em>My life ended yesterday. This is just&mldr; like some bonus round in a video game.</em></p>
<p><em>A what?</em></p>
<p><em>A form of entertainment people in my world engaged in as a way to pass time.</em></p>
<p><em>How dare you? This is far more important than some game!</em></p>
<p><em>It may be very important to you. But haven&rsquo;t you got the memo? I don&rsquo;t care at all!</em></p>
<p>The ball drew itself up, unable to digest this statement. <em>Even if you die?</em></p>
<p><em>It would be a shame to die again, but I wouldn&rsquo;t be too upset. After all, this place doesn&rsquo;t have running water, internet, amazon or any of the comforts of modern life. Oh, but slavery and human rights violations are everywhere! Not to mention dangerous things like beast tides, and yaoguai and what else?</em> Jiaojiao made a show of holding her chin. <em>Oh right, the patriarchy! Mustn&rsquo;t forget that women are second class citizens in this place. If I didn&rsquo;t know any better, I&rsquo;d think I&rsquo;d gone to hell and this was a scenario cooked up by demons just to torture me.</em></p>
<p>Guang Qiu went still, it&rsquo;s light dimming to an alarming level. It floated there, unresponsive no matter how many times Jiaojiao called it. Her eyes sparkled as she reached out and gave it a poke, but her fingers felt nothing as they passed through its smokey form.</p>
<p><em>What are you doing?!</em></p>
<p><em>I thought you&rsquo;d suffered a critical error,</em> she sighed in disappointment. <em>Is it such a blow, knowing I have no motivation to live?</em></p>
<p><em>How will the plot progress if the heroine doesn&rsquo;t behave herself?</em> It asked itself sadly. <em>My perfect record. Gone.</em></p>
<p><em>Oh, do you have a hard-ass for a boss? I can relate.</em></p>
<p><em>This isn&rsquo;t about that at all! Do you have any concept of the havoc a derailed fate-line would wreak? Bai Jing was a force for change in this world! Many events will turn out differently without her presence.</em></p>
<p><em>Who can say if what she did was for the better?</em> Jiaojiao sneered. <em>You read the book. She wasn&rsquo;t some good person that spread love and cheer. She started wars, ended thousands of lives.</em></p>
<p><em>Even your tiny mortal brain should understand that sometimes hard decisions need to be made for the greater good.</em></p>
<p><em>I can&rsquo;t agree with that at all. I might not be a good person, and I&rsquo;m not an expert in ancient court politics, but even I know that a war of succession doesn&rsquo;t need to be fought on the battlefield with the lives of the subjects as fodder!</em></p>
<p><em>Is that why you don&rsquo;t want to get involved with Mo Wudi? Because you don&rsquo;t want to get involved with the war?</em></p>
<p><em>Um, there are so many many reasons I don&rsquo;t want to get involved with a seventeen year old boy, but yeah, go ahead, list that as one of them.</em></p>
<p><em>You think he will put down his quest for revenge without your presence? Don&rsquo;t be a fool! He will be worse without a guiding presence by his side! Bai Jing was the one who kept him from turning this empire into a sea of blood and flame!</em></p>
<p>Jiaojiao shook her head. <em>Even if that&rsquo;s true, I can&rsquo;t be the so-called guiding presence.</em></p>
<p><em>Why not?</em></p>
<p><em>What right does an outsider to this world have to meddle in its conflicts? Wouldn&rsquo;t someone of this world&ndash;</em></p>
<p><em>It has to be you! No one else will do!</em> Guang Qiu admitted in a burst of passion.</p>
<p><em>Why?</em></p>
<p><em>I&mldr; can&rsquo;t tell you that.</em></p>
<p><em>Why am I not surprised?</em> Jiaojiao hefted her staff and made for the door of the pawnshop.</p>
<p><em>Where are you going now?</em></p>
<p><em>You&rsquo;ll see.</em></p>
<p>Jiaojiao leaned heavily on the staff as she entered the shop. The air was richly scented with sandalwood and ambergris. The worker behind the counter looked up as she stumbled and nearly fell, making a show of dragging her bad leg. The worker&rsquo;s eyes lingered on her dusty robe and her rustic straw hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; she said fretfully, holding a sleeve to her eyes. &ldquo;My grandmother came here yesterday to pawn a bracelet. I&rsquo;m here to redeem it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The worker, the same man who had tried to stop Bai Xingwu from leaving with the bracelet, avoided Jiaojiao&rsquo;s eyes, as if he already knew which bracelet and which grandmother she was speaking of. &ldquo;May I see your token?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao placed Cen Wei&rsquo;s token on the counter. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s' a keepsake of my dear mother, but I fell down some stairs and broke my leg yesterday&ndash;&rdquo; she sniffed, blinking back a a dewy batch of tears, &ldquo;&ndash;but we didn&rsquo;t have the money! So my grandmother&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been sold.&rdquo; The hapless man looked very much like he wanted the ground to open up and eat him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao drew her head back, as if unable to comprehend his words. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry, the bracelet has been sold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mldr; shouldn&rsquo;t there be a thirty day waiting period?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was our mistake,&rdquo; the man bowed his head. &ldquo;I will take responsibility and compensate you with another bracelet if you so wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao&rsquo;s tears ran freely down her cheeks. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t w-want another b-bracelet, I want my mother&rsquo;s bracelet!&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>How ugly. You think you can charm him with those ugly looks of yours?</em> Guang Qiu muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very very sorry!&rdquo; the man said, his young face creased in distress. &ldquo;I will compensate you the full price of what we gave that girl today!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait just a minute!&rdquo; a shrill voice cut in. &ldquo;What do you think you&rsquo;re doing Ji Xin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This young miss&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you wasting time with a peasant? Just drive her out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this how you conduct business?!&rdquo; Jiaojiao screeched through her tears, her attitude going from helpless waif to belligerent shrew. &ldquo;I demand to know where my bracelet has gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been sold!&rdquo; the man with the pointy beard pointed at Jiaojiao&rsquo;s face, &ldquo;what an ugly girl! You have the face to come out in public and scare people? Just crawl back to the countryside from where you came! Don&rsquo;t dirty people&rsquo;s eyes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hah! You want to drive me out with that?&rdquo; Jiaojiao drew her staff up as if gearing up for battle. &ldquo;You think I&rsquo;m ugly? Heh! Your face will be worst after I&rsquo;m done with you! Just see if I let you do business in this town again! I&rsquo;ll shout from the rooftops how the Ji clan doesn&rsquo;t know how to conduct business! How their pawnshop cheats honest people! See if I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pointy-bearded man sneered. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re just a little girl! What can you do? That bracelet was sold to the Bai family, go take it up with them if you dare!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heh! You think the poor are easily bullied? Just wait and see! All I have to do is say two words in the ears of those gossiping servants down at market. You&rsquo;ll be the talk of the town tomorrow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You dare&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man&ndash;Ji Xin, hastily pulled the skinny man aside bending close to whisper in his ear. The two had an angry protracted conversation while Jiaojiao impatiently rapped her staff on the ground.</p>
<p>The younger man soon came back, his handsome face creased in a smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry for the wait,&rdquo; he said, sliding a pouch over the counter.</p>
<p>Jiaojiao sniffed and pulled the pouch open. Inside were several silver coins. &ldquo;Was that so hard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pointy-bearded man looked as if he was ready to murder. Jiaojiao flashed a smile, then simply turned to leave.</p>
<p><em>You&rsquo;re a cheat,</em> Guang Qiu said. <em>Cen Wei was already paid for the bracelet. How does that man calculate? Their business will be run into the ground sooner or later if they keep this up.</em></p>
<p><em>You can&rsquo;t put a price on reputation,</em> Jiaojiao smiled. <em>Merchants don&rsquo;t have high social class to begin with. If they are accused of corruption, the officials will swoop in and then they&rsquo;ll have nothing. Besides, it&rsquo;s a fact that they broke their own rules.</em></p>
<p>Jiaojiao relaxed into the rickshaw, allowing her mind to wander. It was taxing on her starved body to drag her dead leg about. She was done with the day hours ago.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until she jolted awake in a dark, deserted alley that she realized something had gone very wrong.</p>
<p><em>Wake up, mortal! You&rsquo;re in danger!</em></p>
<p><em>Guang Qiu, what&rsquo;s happening?</em> she asked groggily. Her sleepiness was short-lived, however, when she noticed the young rickshaw driver had climbed over the back of the cart and had a dagger pointed at her throat.</p>
<p><em>Isn&rsquo;t it obvious?</em> Guang Qiu sighed. <em>You&rsquo;re being robbed.</em></p>
