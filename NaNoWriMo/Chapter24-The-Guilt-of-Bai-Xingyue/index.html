<p><em>A beautiful little girl wanders into a large hall, a rattle drum held in one hand. Her soft red robe bounces with each step. A tall man stands next to a slender woman.</em></p>
<p>*&ldquo;Father! Mother!&rdquo; the little girl says, running to the two. *</p>
<p><em>The man laughs and scoops her up in his arms. &ldquo;Yue&rsquo;er, don&rsquo;t run! What if you fall?"</em></p>
<p><em>The woman smiles and reaches up to touch the girls cheek. &ldquo;Yueyue is getting taller every day."</em></p>
<p>*The girl is a little taller. She shyly hands a white peony blossom to a young boy wearing a golden hair crown. The boy bows and takes it. *</p>
<p><em>The girl is taller still, she kneels worriedly at the side of a bed. A pale woman lies there, sweaty, glassy eyes. She places a trembling hand on the girl&rsquo;s head, eyes looking past her.</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Baby, mother is sorry she couldn&rsquo;t save you."</em></p>
<p><em>The girl is dressed in white, her eyes red as they carry a coffin into a stone tomb set into the side of a misty hill. The tall man has his head bowed. He reaches over and takes the young girl by the hand.</em></p>
<p><em>The young girl hides in the shadows as the tall man listens to another man say. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry Official Bai, the girl has withered meridians. She has no way of cultivating in this lifetime."</em></p>
<p><em>The girl is strapped to a wide table. They cut her open. She screams but they don&rsquo;t</em> stop.</p>
<p><em>A teenager with the same face as the tall man lies on a neighboring table, his eyes bright.</em></p>
<p>*The girl sits in a waterside pavilion. She has grown taller again, but there is no smile on her face. She is thin. Pale. *</p>
<p><em>A teenager strolls into the pagoda. He reaches for the girl&rsquo;s braids. &ldquo;Little sister, you look lovely today."</em></p>
<p><em>The scene is engulfed with white flame.</em></p>
<p><em>The girl lies, pain wracked on a bed. Blood flows from her broken leg, shards of bone protruding from the skin.</em></p>
<p><em>An old woman comes and wipes the sweat from her brow. &ldquo;Endure it Yueyue."</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Where is the doctor?&rdquo; the girl rasps.</em></p>
<p><em>There is no answer.</em></p>
<p><em>A girl sits in front of a mirror. Her beautiful face is marked with a red dot the size of a cherry blossom. The old woman clucks in worry next to her. &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t know what has happened to your face! Don&rsquo;t worry Yueyue, I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s will disappear on it&rsquo;s own."</em></p>
<p>*A girl sits in a lonely courtyard, her face obscured with red. A second girl comes. She is full of sharp words and anger. *</p>
<p><em>The years roll by like a picture scroll. Each more empty and lonely than the last. She no longer has her beauty or her happiness.</em></p>
<p>*&ldquo;You are so disgusting.&rdquo; *</p>
<p>*&ldquo;So ugly!&rdquo; *</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;You slut."</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;You got what you deserved."</em></p>
<p><em>The girl looks up as a beautiful girl in white offers her hand. &ldquo;Sister, won&rsquo;t you come with me to the imperial banquet?"</em></p>
<p><em>The girl is drowning. She reaches for the girl in white, but she stands by coldly as the girl flails in the water.</em></p>
<p><em>I see. This is where it ends.</em></p>
<p><em>The girl stops struggling and lets the water close over her. The girl in white says something, but the words are lost in the silent world. A thin film separates them, but they are in separate worlds, as they have always been.</em></p>
<p><em>Why. Why. Why. Why. Why.</em></p>
<p><em>WHY?</em></p>
<p>The scene evaporates like smoke.</p>
<p>Jiaojiao woke, gasping for air. She clutched at her head.</p>
<p><em>Jiaojiao? Who is Jiaojiao?</em></p>
<p><em>I am Bai Xingyue. Third daughter of the Bai family.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m not!&rdquo; Jiaojiao punched herself in the temple. &ldquo;Get the fuck out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voices and shapes in her head did not disappear. Jiaojiao stood shakily, flinging aside the moth-eaten covers. She staggered past the broken door, the worn furniture, the dusty cobwebs. A full moon hung over the gloomy courtyard. A night creature called out before falling silent abruptly, its cry was cut short. Jiaojiao let the moonlight wash over her.</p>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s all your fault.</em></p>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s not! I&rsquo;m not you!</em></p>
<p><em>You know what you need to do.</em></p>
<p>The girl gave a grunt of frustration and went back inside. She kicked the low tea-table upside down and worked a leg free from the carcass. She took the make-shift club and came to Cen Wei&rsquo;s door.</p>
<p>Moonlight flooded the room as the girl eased the door open. The woman didn&rsquo;t stir when the girl came to the head of her kang and brought the table leg down on her head, groaning when the girl tied her down to the four posts of her bed.</p>
<p>The girl lit an old lantern and brought it close to the woman&rsquo;s head. She stared at the woman&rsquo;s face for a long long time, then turned to rummage in the surroundings. The girl found the secret compartment in her wardrobe and unearthed a fist-sized bag of powder. She dumped it into the pitcher of water on the servant&rsquo;s table and stirred.</p>
<p>Cen Wei coughed and gagged as the girl pinched her mouth open and carefully poured the liquid mixture into her mouth, eyes flat, expression grim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Awake?&rdquo; the girl asked the old woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;W-what did you feed me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found it in your wardrobe. You should know better than me what it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s eyes nearly popped out of their sockets. She coughed and retched, trying to vomit out the contents of her stomach. The girl observed her antics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t even stand a single taste? I ate it everyday for eight years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yueyue! Untie me right now!&rdquo; The old woman screamed.</p>
<p>Yueyue cocked her head, then brought the club down on the woman&rsquo;s leg. Once. Twice. Thrice.</p>
<p>The old woman howled as her bones, brittle with age snapped under the girl&rsquo;s continued onslaught. Not satisfied, the girl repeated her actions with the other leg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll kill you!&rdquo; the old woman screeched through her wails of pain. &ldquo;You little whore! I&rsquo;ll kill you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another club to the woman&rsquo;s cheek had her curses cut short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Servant, know your place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman&rsquo;s eyes were bloodshot with rage, but she bit back her words. &ldquo;Yueyue, why are you doing this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long will you play dumb? Did you really think I didn&rsquo;t know what you were doing all those years?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman chewed on her lip. &ldquo;You knew you were being poisoned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew. I knew you were working for the Mu family too. I also know that my mother asked you to poison me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A frigid silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t understand why.&rdquo; The girls' eyes grew faint with confusion and hurt. &ldquo;Why did she do that to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hah! You understand nothing!&rdquo; the old woman spat. &ldquo;You are a sinner! You deserve everything that happened to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really think you are Haoru&rsquo;s daughter? You look nothing like her! You look nothing like your so-called father!&rdquo; Cen Wei laughed. &ldquo;If that ugly thing on your face wasn&rsquo;t there, it would be obvious to all that you&rsquo;re a bastard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl held her head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not&mldr;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are! You&rsquo;re some wild seed dropped on Haoru&rsquo;s doorstep! And your real parents,&rdquo; the old servant hawked a glob of phlegm and spat it at the girl. &ldquo;They are murderers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re lying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can still lie about this? The day&mldr; " the servant&rsquo;s eyes grew misty. &ldquo;I saw it. A man snuck into young miss‚Äôs room. He touched her stomach as she lay sleeping and the next day she went into labor! Flame colored auspicious clouds rose above the estate, but the baby was stillborn.&rdquo; Cen Wei&rsquo;s eyes grew fearful as she recalled. &ldquo;He walked among the servants, but it was as if no one could see him. He placed you in her arms and it was as if she had forgotten the dead baby at her side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cen Wei&rsquo;s eyes grew fierce. &ldquo;He tried to trick me too, but he was injured. He couldn&rsquo;t make me forget.&rdquo; She laughed, high-pitched, manic. &ldquo;He placed the dead baby in my arms and told me to bury it. He left something for you too. He told me to give it to you when you came of age. But I threw it away! You&rsquo;ll never find it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl gave a sharp cry of pain, and knelt, hands holding her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You‚Äôre nothing but a cuckoo occupying the magpies nest. You&rsquo;re not your mothers' daughter at all. You&rsquo;re nothing but the daughter of the murderer that killed her baby. Hah, you&rsquo;re lucky she even kept you for seven years. She should have strangled you the moment I told her the truth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl looked up, but the set of her shoulders, her eyes, and most of all, her expression were as different as night and day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you done?&rdquo; Jiaojiao rose, smacking the club against her free hand. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind hitting you a few more times if it will help you keep a civil tongue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cen Wei glared, but gulped as she looked at the table leg. &ldquo;What do you want to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you do with the thing that that man wanted you to give her&ndash;uh, me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I threw it away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao smacked the club lightly on the servant&rsquo;s broken legs. The old woman screeched and drew back as far as she could with her arms and legs tied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine fine! I buried it with the dead baby!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you bury it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under the peach tree in the old courtyard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no peach tree here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not this place. Haoru&rsquo;s old courtyard,&rdquo; she gave Jiaojiao a peculiar look. &ldquo;You should remember it. You were very happy in those times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao couldn&rsquo;t remember, but Bai Xingyue could. She rubbed her aching brows, a massive migraine pounding away in her temples. &ldquo;Uh huh, very happy. I&rsquo;m glad we had this talk.&rdquo; A cold smile crept onto her face. &ldquo;Really glad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&mldr; what will you do with me?&rdquo; Cen Wei said in a hushed voice, staring at Jiaojiao as if she were a stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you know fear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t kill me, I can help you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help me how? Help me the same way you helped me these past years?&rdquo; Jiaojiao knelt on the bed with a laugh and swished the remaining liquid in the pitcher. &ldquo;Drink the rest of the water and I won&rsquo;t kill you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman nodded frantically. Jiaojiao poured the rest of the murky water into her mouth, watching dispassionately to make sure the old woman didn&rsquo;t spit it out.</p>
<p>She waved a hand and blew out the lantern, casting the room into darkness save for the stream of moonlight in the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave you alive for now. Try not to make too much noise. Who knows if might come back to finish the job I started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a last look, Jiaojiao shut the door on the fearful servant. She walked back to her own room with a daze and sat there in the dark, not bothering to light a candle or lantern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come out. I know you&rsquo;re there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When there was only silence, Jiaojiao slammed a palm on the kang. &ldquo;Get out right now, or I&rsquo;m drowning myself in the nearest pond!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A dim ball of light popped into view directly above her. Jiaojiao gave it a mirthless laugh. &ldquo;You fucker. You really dared&mldr;&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>I had no choice,</em> the ball said, sounding almost apologetic. <em>I looked at the fate-lines. This was the only way to get you to follow&ndash;</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;By fucking with my memories?!&rdquo; Jiaojiao threw the porcelain pillow at the ball. It passed harmlessly through it to crash into the wall, breaking in two.</p>
<p><em>Your memories are intact, I merely repaired the damaged areas in your brain so you would recover the body&rsquo;s existing memory.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;You make it sound like you did nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Why are you are so angry?</em> The ball asked, genuinely baffled, <em>You weren&rsquo;t even this angry when I brought you to this place or when I threatened to kill you&mldr;</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;This is worse, this is far worse.&rdquo; Jiaojiao held her aching head. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve fucking given me multiple personality disorder. You utter <strong>shluha vokzal‚Äônaja</strong>! <sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>What&mldr; what does that mean?</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what, don&rsquo;t talk to me. Just shut up. Shut up for the rest of eternity.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>You can&rsquo;t expect me to&ndash;</em></p>
<p>Jiaojiao shut her eyes and lay back on the bed, folding her hands across her chest. &ldquo;Just shut your whore mouth for once in your life, Guang Qiu.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>You&ndash;</em></p>
<p>Guang Qiu paused in astonishment.</p>
<p>One second they were no in a the dilapidated room of Bai Xingyue, and then next&mldr;</p>
<p>They were in a wide open hall, white stone walls enclosed all sides, but the roof was split open to a cerulean sky. Fluffy clouds drifted playfully on the wind.</p>
<p>Sunlight lanced through wide latticed windows with complex geometric patterns, casting dazzling shadows on the elaborate mosaic tiled floors. Ivy crept over the wide sill, spilling greenery onto the walls and floors.</p>
<p>A tall girl with perfectly styled brown hair stood in the center of the hall, she gazed at the sunlight playing over her hands, holding her elaborately decorated nails to the light.</p>
<p>Guang Qiu buzzed in alarm. <em>You&ndash;you!!</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it Guang Qiu?&rdquo; Jiaojiao said with a tsk. &ldquo;You look like you&rsquo;ve seen a ghost.&rdquo;</p>
