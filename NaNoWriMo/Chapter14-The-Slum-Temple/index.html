<p>Jiaojiao shrunk back as the children crowded around the creaky rickshaw. Their hands reaching for her staff, her robes, her face, and poked curiously at her splinted leg.</p>
<p>Tu Wenfeng straightened, back rigid as he the children gazed up at him with laughing faces. &ldquo;Tutu! You&rsquo;re back! Did you bring anything good to eat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alright, get away!&rdquo; Tu Wenfeng barked, pulling the rickshaw into the entryway, not at all minding the three or four toddlers clinging to his legs and back. &ldquo;Get out of the way! What if the rickshaw runs you over?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apparently this possibility only caused the children greater amusement, as even more jumped on Tu Wenfeng&rsquo;s back and one even crawled into the rickshaw with Jiaojiao, squeezing next to her broken leg until the newly set bone creaked ominously.</p>
<p>If Mo Wudi had nearly given her a heart attack, then these children were close to giving her an aneurism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out of the cart Min Tong, you stupid ghost!&rdquo; Tu Wenfeng scolded without venom. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see she&rsquo;s injured?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Min Tong, a monkey-faced pipsqueak shot gave Jiaojiao a pout, but obediently jumped out of the rickshaw.</p>
<p>Tu Wenfeng parked the cart next to a crumbling wall, then turned awkwardly to Jiaojiao, who was hesitant to descend the cart into perilous goblin territory. She watched as the children milled about the rickshaw, speaking over one another to be heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tutu, what about Yanyan? Are you treading on two boats?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could you forget Yanyan for this ghost face?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that mark on her face?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao almost felt self-conscious. Children after all, had no filter. Even if she told herself she didn&rsquo;t have any reason to feel ashamed of her appearance, she still felt a stab of annoyance. She turned to that bratty voice and smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name? Min Tong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little boy thrust out his chin. &ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This red mark on my face is a sign of a curse,&rdquo; Jiaojiao said with a bitter sigh. &ldquo;A goddess saw that I was more beautiful than her, so she cursed me to look&ndash;&rdquo; she took her sleeve and rubbed away the rest of the powder, revealing the ugly mark in all it&rsquo;s mottled veiny glory &ldquo;&ndash;like this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Min Tong gaped at Jiaojiao&rsquo;s face for a whole second, then screamed as if he was being lit on fire. &ldquo;Monster! It&rsquo;s a guai! Guai!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A wet stain appeared between his legs as he ran away as quickly as his stubby two legs could carry him, screaming all the while.</p>
<p>Like a devastating chemical reaction, two more children took one look at Jiaojiao&rsquo;s face, then began to scream, similar wet puddles appearing at their feet. Three, then seven more children ran away, fleeing from the scene of carnage.</p>
<p>Tu Wenfeng stared at Jiaojiao&rsquo;s uncovered face, then the gaggle of distressed children on the far side of the courtyard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? They were noisy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t have to frighten them into pissing themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a temple for the Goddess Nuwa,&rdquo; he gave Jiaojiao a pointed look. &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t speak so freely about gods in this place, they may hear you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao bit back a sarcastic remark, remembering once again she was in a place of gods and demons. &ldquo;Not going to comment on this?&rdquo; Jiaojiao she said insteadn, pointing at the mark on her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s none of my business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I commend your conduct,&rdquo; Jiaojiao applauded. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, I&rsquo;ll tell anyway. Anyway, so the goddess&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>What nonsense are you spouting?</em> Guang Qiu interrupted. <em>Are you calling Head Wife Zhang a goddess?</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;She said that as long as I earn a hundred gold ingots and donate them in her name, then the curse will be lifted.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Why would a goddess care about mortal wealth? What utter&ndash;</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your plan to earn money?&rdquo; Tu Wenfeng said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve brought you to my home. You hold up your end of the deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao put down her hands. &ldquo;Fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tu Wenfeng looked away as Jiaojiao struggled down from the cart, only turning back to here when she made an impatient noise. She thumped her staff and gestured. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to invite me to sit down? You expect to have a conversation while standing around? Might I remind you my leg is injured. "</p>
<p>The teenager looked like he was approaching the end of his patience, but led the way into a run-down wooden house with floorboards creaking with each step.</p>
<p>The children had gotten over their upset and drew closer to them , peering around the edge of the doorway as Tu Wenfeng invited Jiaojiao a seat at the low table and a ratty floor cushion.</p>
<p>Jiaojiao had never missed modern furniture more than this moment as she awkwardly lowered herself to sit on the floor, leg pointed outward like a fallen tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mentioned some money making ideas, but they are all dependent on your cooperation. I can&rsquo;t do much by myself. Furthermore, much of it requires man power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the power I meant. I mean many able hands, they don&rsquo;t necessarily need to be as strong as you,&rdquo; Jiaojiao glanced at the children, who fled screaming at the sight of her face. &ldquo;I suppose children would do just fine. Unless there&rsquo;s child labor laws I don&rsquo;t know about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Child labor what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao threw up a hand. &ldquo;I supposed I was worried for no reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyhow,&rdquo; Jiaojiao placed the pouch on the scarred table. &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ve been operating in good faith by bringing me here, you can keep a hold of the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pouch disappeared beyond Tu Wenfeng&rsquo;s lapels.</p>
<p><em>You are too optimistic,</em> Guang Qiu sneered. <em>What makes you think he&rsquo;ll listen to anything you say? What if spends the money randomly?</em></p>
<p><em>With his girlfriend&rsquo;s life on the line? Unlikely. If I didn&rsquo;t give him the money, he would have taken it sooner or later. The only reason he brought me here is because he&rsquo;s hesitant to kill me. He most likely doesn&rsquo;t have high hopes for whatever I have to say, but he&rsquo;s desperate enough to try.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you have any paper?&rdquo; Jiaojiao said outloud.</p>
<p>Tu Wenfeng took a sardonic glance around the room. &ldquo;Does it look like we can afford something so expensive.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Yikes, Iooks like paper is out of play.</em> &ldquo;Fine, can you at least get me some bamboo slips and ink?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bamboo is easy, but ink is more difficult.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t expect me to write in the mud with a stick, can you?&rdquo; Jiaojiao said.</p>
<p>Two minutes later, they were sitting in the entryway, Jiaojiao with a stick confiscated from a child squeezed in her hand.</p>
<p>Irritably, she began to scratch out hesitant characters in the dirt.</p>
<p><em>Why is your writing so ugly?</em></p>
<p><em>Well, if your writing looks any better using a stick, then I applaud you. Besides, you should be thankful I know traditional Chinese at all. In my world, most people use simplified.</em></p>
<p>Slowly a list of jagged characters appeared on the ground.</p>
<p>Materials to get:</p>
<ul>
<li>tannery scraps, leather doesn&rsquo;t need to be large, but shouldn&rsquo;t have defects if you can help it</li>
<li>twine; <del>silk</del>, hemp or cotton. <del>(is silk too expensive? It probably is nevermind.)</del></li>
<li>river stones: should be smooth, with interesting colors or patterns are preferred but not absolutely necessary</li>
<li>paper: it doesn&rsquo;t need to be very good quality, just enough to write clearly on.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tu Wenfeng scowled down at it. &ldquo;What is this gibberish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is phase one,&rdquo; Jiaojiao said mysteriously. &ldquo;Of course, all of this is dependent on whether we can source materials. Am I to understand there is a mercenary guild in this town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does that have to do with anything? We can&rsquo;t afford to hire anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t hiring to them, we&rsquo;re selling!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could we possibly have that would be&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay enough questions!&rdquo; Jiaojiao clapped her hands together briskly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve upheld my end of the deal. You have the money. It&rsquo;s your move.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tu Wenfeng stared at her, and she could tell he was very close to just driving her out, sans money, morals be damned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to save your Yanyan? You think that beggar&rsquo;s pittance will be enough to buy her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tu Wenfeng closed his eyes and sighed. &ldquo;Very well, I hope you aren&rsquo;t lying to me or simply a fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao gave him a set of detailed instructions, then slouched over the low table. <em>This day has been far too long.</em></p>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s only the afternoon.</em></p>
<p><em>Don&rsquo;t remind me.</em></p>
<p>An old woman, squinting in the dim light, tottered into the room under a basket of dirty linens. &ldquo;Tutu? What is happening?&rdquo; she blinked myopically at Jiaojiao. &ldquo;We have a visitor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is&mldr;&rdquo; he glanced to Jiaojiao, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t catch your name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can call me Jiaojiao.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made the introductions briefly, explained to the half-deaf old woman, named Chu Hua, in a loud voice that Jiaojiao would be staying with them for a few days.</p>
<p>Chu Hua sighed and waved a hand in exasperation. &ldquo;Everyday he brings home another stray.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tu Wenfeng left shortly after to finish the day&rsquo;s work and perhaps find some of what Jiaojiao had instructed. The old woman went out the door, bent in half under the weight of her basket. Children streamed after her, asking questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you talk with the guai, Granny Hua?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see it&rsquo;s face?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it here to eat us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Granny, let me help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aiya!&rdquo; Chu Hua cried out, seeing all the children with wet trousers and soiled robes. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I told you not to wait to go to the outhouse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t our fault!&rdquo; Min Tong stood out front, all three feet of him trembling as he pointed at Jiaojiao. &ldquo;It was that monster over there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao turned a deaf ear as the children heaped a layer of accusations on her, though she spared a guilty glance over all the extra washing that would no doubt fall on that overworked granny.</p>
<p><em>What do you hope to achieve in this run-down place? Besides traumatizing children?</em> Guang Qiu asked gloomily. <em>This is a waste of time.</em></p>
<p><em>It isn&rsquo;t a waste,</em> Jiaojiao&rsquo;s eyes shone. <em>This is an opportunity! Besides, this place isn&rsquo;t much worse than Bai Xingyue&rsquo;s courtyard. What does it matter if I&rsquo;m suffering here or I&rsquo;m suffering there? Not to mention, doesn&rsquo;t Bai Xingwu like to visit every so often to torment Bai Xingyue? Isn&rsquo;t it wise to stay away from that pink calamity until my leg isn&rsquo;t quite so brittle?</em></p>
<p>The granny shote Jiaojiao a confused look, then towed the crowd of children away like a flagship. Jiaojiao enjoyed the afternoon sunlight streaming though the open doorway, not even blinking an eye at the straggling children who stayed to goggle at her or whisper about her supposed demonic attributes.</p>
<p><em>You aren&rsquo;t at all uncomfortable being seen as a monster by these children?</em></p>
<p><em>Why should I worry about what a bunch of crotch goblins think? Besides, most of them have their own problems.</em> Jiaojiao gestured at a young boy missing his left arm, arguing with that pissant, Min Tong as he dug a hole in the soft dirt of the courtyard with a stick. <em>For example, I&rsquo;m at least better off than him. I have all my limbs. Or that girl over there. Does&rsquo;t she have a hare-lip? If they can play happily together with her, it won&rsquo;t be long until they accept me. Right?</em></p>
<p>The granny came back with an empty basket, the children peeling away from her when she entered the house, hesitant to come closer to the ghost-faced girl. &ldquo;The children seem to like you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that what this is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they didn&rsquo;t like you, they would be throwing mud,&rdquo; she laughed wearily. &ldquo;Many donations have flown away due to their behavior.&rdquo; She didn&rsquo;t seem angry at this occurrence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened to this temple?&rdquo; Jiaojiao asked.</p>
<p>She sighed, eyes cloudy as she gazed at the timeworn surroundings. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fallen on hard times and isn&rsquo;t as popular as it once was after they built a newer one in a cleaner part of the capital. No one comes here anymore unless it&rsquo;s to get rid of a burden. It&rsquo;s become a place for abandoned children. Whether it&rsquo;s because their family is too poor, or they have other things that aren&rsquo;t acceptable, they end up here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do they become monks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The granny nodded. &ldquo;Some of them. A monk visits every year. If a suitable child is found, they move to another temple in the mountains. However, not many get picked. Even the gods don&rsquo;t want the ones that end up here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao smiled mirthlessly. <em>It seems the more things are different, the more they are the same.</em></p>
<p><em>What does that mean?</em></p>
<p><em>Nevermind. Just thought of something sad from the past. It all started when I was a young child, there was a&ndash;</em> Jiaojiao trailed off, eyes misty with unshed tears.</p>
<p><em>There was a what?</em> Guang Qiu asked.</p>
<p>Jiaojiao shot Guang Qiu a provocative look. <em>Why, you curious?</em></p>
<p><em>What? Why would I care about your past&ndash;</em></p>
<p><em>Oh. Then I won&rsquo;t tell you.</em></p>
<p>Guang Qiu buzzed, choked into silence. &ldquo;You&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chu Hua woman gazed blearily at the same spot where Guang Qiu hung in the air. &ldquo;Is there something on the wall? My old eyes aren&rsquo;t very good. If there&rsquo;s a cockroach, don&rsquo;t mind it. As long as you wipe your mouth after you eat, they should leave you alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao turned a set of wide eyes on Chu Hua. &ldquo;You have cockroaches?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They usually only come out at night, but if it rains you will see more,&rdquo; she said conversationally. &ldquo;Did you not have them where you used to live?&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Guang Qiu, we are leaving right away!</em></p>
<p><em>Hehe, aren&rsquo;t you exactly where you wanted to be? What&rsquo;s the use of crying to me now?</em></p>
<p><em>What do you understand? Cockroaches! I&rsquo;ve never even seen on in real life before!</em></p>
<p><em>Why are you so disturbed? They aren&rsquo;t so different from every other bug.</em></p>
<p><em>Not so different? I beg to fucking differ!</em></p>
<p>Chu Hua turned a concerned eye at the frozen Jiaojiao, whose face was going through several expressions in rapid succession as she stared at nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tutu always finds the oddest ones.&rdquo;</p>
