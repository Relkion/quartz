<p><em>What are you doing?</em></p>
<p>Jiaojiao ignored the ball of light in favor of peeking through one of the many holes in the front window. The old woman, Cen Wei, was cheerfully puttering about in the courtyard. Jiaojiao watched with morbid curiosity as the woman went into one of the other buildings and came out with a wooden bucket, a shovel and a length of cloth tied around her face. The woman disappeared into the horrific outhouse Jiaojiao was still suffering ongoing flashbacks about with her implements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is <em>she</em> doing?&rdquo; Jiaojiao asked.</p>
<p><em>You are behaving oddly. I see nothing wrong with the old woman?</em></p>
<p>Jiaojiao didn&rsquo;t reply, busy going over what she knew of Cen Wei from the godawful text in her mind. Cen Wei didn&rsquo;t have much of a presence in The Cold Prince Loves Me Dearly. The sum of her parts was less than five thousand words, a pitiful count in comparison to characters such as Bai Xingwu who had upwards of sixty thousand words describing her interactions with Bai Jing.</p>
<p>Cen Wei was the wet-nurse of Bai Xingyue&rsquo;s mother&ndash; well, her supposed mother, Mu Haoru&ndash; lets not get into that mess right now. But she was a devoted servant from the past generation and had taken care of Bai Xingyue all her life. Despite this, she didn&rsquo;t show doubt at Bai Xingyue&rsquo;s sudden change in personality when Bai Jing took over. Instead, citing her change as her young miss having &ldquo;finally grown up.&rdquo; She was a sycophantic presence next to the transmigrated Bai Jing, never saying a word against this new version of her young miss. Even curiouser, she never once doubted Bai Jing&rsquo;s strength, despite Bai Xingyue being a lifelong cripple with no martial training. From beginning to end, Cen Wei was described as a loyal if somewhat dull-witted servant.</p>
<p>Curious.</p>
<p>Cen Wei came out of the outhouse five minutes later, bucket full of&mldr; Jiaojiao surpressed her churning stomach. &ldquo;You seriously don&rsquo;t see it? This old woman is <em>suss</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>What?</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a servant. If she truly cared for her master then why was this body still wearing the wet clothes after nearly drowning? Isn&rsquo;t it common sense that a person should change clothes after getting them wet? Yet this poor girl lay in soggy clothes all night. There&rsquo;s something wrong with your book.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>So the servant is lazy, it doesn&rsquo;t mean the book is wrong.</em></p>
<p>Another thin smile. &ldquo;Sure hon. But I haven&rsquo;t even gotten to this old woman&rsquo;s real odd points. I mean, just look at her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The was a pause as the ball took an irritated glance at the old woman, now swishing the defiled shovel in the courtyard pond. <em>I see nothing odd about her.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at her, and look at this body,&rdquo; Jiaojiao held up a feeble wrist. &ldquo;What loyal servant is that plump while her master starves? I call bullshit.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>&mldr;perhaps it&rsquo;s simply a difference of physique?</em></p>
<p>Jiaojiao was beginning to think that Guang Qiu wasn&rsquo;t very bright despite his luminous appearance. &ldquo;Yeah? And what about these hands? Just look at these nails!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A chipped nail was thrust in front of Guang Qiu like a piece of case-breaking evidence.</p>
<p><em>&mldr;what about them?</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Um, hello? She&rsquo;s supposed to be the master? Why do her hands look worse than the old lady&rsquo;s? You don&rsquo;t get hands like these unless you&rsquo;re doing hard labor, like handwashing clothes in the dead of winter or something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a considering air emanating from the ball. <em>Perhaps you have a point.</em></p>
<p>Jiaojiao smiled&ndash;</p>
<p><em>But that still doesn&rsquo;t mean the book was wrong. There&rsquo;s nothing here that says that the old woman wasn&rsquo;t simply avoiding her duties. It doesn&rsquo;t mean she is disloyal at heart.</em> The ball insisted, though it didn&rsquo;t seem quite as certain as before.</p>
<p>Jiaojiao rolled her eyes. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t even mentioned the most damning piece of evidence. This one is even backed up by your precious book.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>What evidence?</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xingyue&rsquo;s poison,&rdquo; Jiaojiao said with a smirk. &ldquo;This girl is being poisoned right? Where do you think it&rsquo;s coming from?&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>I don&rsquo;t follow.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I have to spell it out for you? Are you an idiot? Do you even have two brain cells to rub together?&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>You dare insult my intelligence&ndash;</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Cen Wei herself said the kitchens are withholding rations. Where is the poison coming from?&rdquo; Jiaojiao spoke as if to a very slow child.</p>
<p>There was a long, excruciating pause.</p>
<p><em>The poison comes from Head Wife Zhang. It says so in the book.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, but how is it getting to Bai Xingyue, you dumb brick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another sullen pause. <em>Very well, perhaps your suspicions are not totally groundless.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Good lord, he can be taught. Speaking of poison,&rdquo; Jiaojiao said. &ldquo;How exactly do you plan on ridding me of it? It&rsquo;ll be hilarious if after all this talk the body simply keels over. Keels over again, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Because you are an entertainer with no training in the medical arts, I will have to find an alternative way to cure you of the poison currently plaguing you.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, whatever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they spoke, Cen Wei had disappeared from view with her bucket of&mldr; leavings. Perhaps this would lead to a marginal improvement in smell, though Jiaojiao wasn&rsquo;t getting her hopes up. She wasn&rsquo;t too curious about where those leavings were going to end up. Nope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, Guang Qiu&ndash;&rdquo; Jiaojiao ignored the ball as it bristled at its moniker &ldquo;&ndash;if I learn to cultivate, does that I no longer have to use the bathroom?&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>What does that have to do with anything?</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t expect you to understand, since you are but a disembodied orb, but this matter has a direct relation to my sanity, so please answer the question.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>&mldr;once you reach Jindan stage, you will be able to exist solely on spirit energy, thus negating the need to defecate.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Sweet. I&rsquo;ll keep that in mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Perhaps we should now speak of your next move. Given that you&rsquo;re not capable of curing yourself, you&rsquo;ll need to find a doctor. You must fix your leg as soon as possible if you are to keep up with the timeline in the book.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh, do we have to talk about this now?&rdquo; Jiaojiao protested. &ldquo;I need a bath and a <em>real</em> change of clothes, where can I find those? And I haven&rsquo;t even seen what I look like yet! Am I ugly? This body is pretty ugly, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ball seemed out of patience as it began to emanate an unseen pressure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t emote me! Like you can understand when you don&rsquo;t even have a body. Why don&rsquo;t we switch places and I can be the judgmental presence hovering over you instead?&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Don&rsquo;t waste your time wishing for the impossible, mortal!</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever, I&ndash;&rdquo; Jiaojiao paused. &ldquo;Did you see that?&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>What is it now?</em></p>
<p>Jiaojiao stared intently at the hole in the courtyard wall. She could have sworn she saw a face peeking into the yard. Before she could speak again, Cen Wei barged into the room, lugging a large wooden tub. Jiaojiao&rsquo;s eyes lit up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevermind, it&rsquo;s nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What followed was a highly uncomfortable bath with lukewarm water, supervised by an overzealous servant that insisted on scrubbing her from head to toe with a sponge that felt more like a pumice stone. Jiaojiao tried several times to shoo Cen Wei away, unable to forget that those same hands scrubbing her body were engaged in far fouler chores less than an hour ago, and she had yet to see Cen Wei break out an antibacterial soap, but the old servant was not to be deterred.</p>
<p>She was far less concerned about her own nakedness. Jiaojiao didn&rsquo;t feel modesty, she after all, was not in her own body, and even if she were, she had long had modesty drummed out of her by her profession as an &ldquo;entertainer.&rdquo; Jiaojiao finally got a closer look at her new body, and she did not like it one bit.</p>
<p>Bai Xingyue was distressingly skinny, akin to pictures of starving refuges Jiaojiao had seen on the news or in documentaries. There were strange red striations around her joints. Curious, she&rsquo;d pushed on them and felt a spreading numbness. She wanted answers, but Guang Qiu had long excused themselves and Jiaojiao couldn&rsquo;t very well ask Cen Wei the Poisoner, as she caught the servant looking at her with questioning eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is something wrong, Yueyue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, just cold,&rdquo; Jiaojiao said, ducking her head to hide a repulsed shiver.</p>
<p>Cen Wei spread a few crumbs of inferior quality <em>zao dou</em>, or &ldquo;bath beans&rdquo; that gave off a weak lather. Jiaojiao was very interested in the ancient soap, given that she was a sucker for vegan beauty products, but seeing Cen Wei&rsquo;s strange look as she handled the soap sent her inner curiosity deflating.</p>
<p>After the awkward affair, Cen Wei left to dispose of the bathwater while Jiaojiao changed into clothes she reluctantly deemed tolerable, if not acceptable. Homeless chic was <em>never</em> a good look in her mind, but what could you do when you were the disgraced and bullied second miss of a cold, impersonal clan?</p>
<p>Guang Qiu reappeared the moment Jiaojiao was dressed, sending her impatient vibes. <em>You mortals are so troublesome.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, spare me the lecture about mortal filth,&rdquo; Jiaojiao said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you talking to, Yueyue?&rdquo; Cen Wei asked with a concerned frown, craning her head around the broken door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody, just talking myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>You don&rsquo;t have to speak aloud,</em> Guang Qiu said with condescension. <em>I can hear your thoughts.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;No you can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Jiaojiao said. &ldquo;If you could, you&rsquo;d be far angrier with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>I can hear thoughts you direct at me.</em></p>
<p><em>Can you hear this, sad rave?</em> Jiaojiao thought cautiously, not attempting to &ldquo;send&rdquo; thoughts.</p>
<p><em>Brainless nightlight,</em> she thought with slightly more intent.</p>
<p><em>Discount disco,</em> she tried again when Guang Qui showed no reaction.</p>
<p><em>What,</em> if Guang Qiu had teeth, Jiaojiao didn&rsquo;t doubt she would have heard them grinding that very moment. <em>Is a disco.</em></p>
<p>Jiaojiao&rsquo;s reply was interrupted as Cen Wei returned with a comb with missing teeth and a battered bronze mirror. &ldquo;Yueyue, come here, let me dry your hair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao dutifully sat on the ground by the low table and Cen Wei placed the dented mirror in front of her. It looked much like something that should be on exhibit at a museum, complete with an ages worth of scratches and shedding teal flakes of oxidation. The servant had a strange glint in her eye and Jiaojiao didn&rsquo;t have long to wonder why as she got a look at the face in the mirror.</p>
<p>Bai Jing in the webnovel had been described as a world-stopping beauty, both before her death and as her reincarnation in Bai Xingyue&rsquo;s body. The face in the mirror however, lacked any sort of grace or enviable qualities so extoled by the author. There was no smooth skin, or brilliant eyes shining with determination or haughtiness inherent to those confident in their own worth. There was no lustrous black hair or red ruby lips. No oval-shaped face, or long, curled lashes, like that of a butterfly&rsquo;s wing.</p>
<p>There reflected in the bronze was a small, weak girl, a large, muddy-red stain marred the left half of her face, covering most of her forehead, cutting down across the middle of her face, lashing her nosebridge and over her left eye. Most of her left cheek was similarly discolored and the stain went on to cover most of her ear and extend into her hairline. The mark was a deep maroon, mottled, and had strange squiggly marks like veins.</p>
<p>Jiaojiao raised a hand and placed in on the mark, deep in thought. Cen Wei spoke by her ear. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be sad, miss, you are still very beautiful in my heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>If you knew she would be sad, why put the mirror in front of her, you sadistic old biddy.</em> If Jiaojiao still had doubts about Cen Wei&rsquo;s attitude about her charge, they were thoroughly dispelled in this second. She actually sounded happy at the thought that the young girl would be distressed by her own ugliness.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Jiaojiao was here, and Jiaojiao, though self-confessed to be incurably vain, wasn&rsquo;t stupid enough to confuse her own face with the face of the stranger in the mirror. And more importantly, wasn&rsquo;t Bai Jing able to dispel this mark from her face with relative ease? It hadn&rsquo;t even taken her five chapters in fact.</p>
<p>But what did Guang Qiu think of all this? Jiaojiao shot it a meaningful glance, but it hovered there, unaffected by the scene of an old woman tormenting a young girl with her own inadequacies. Whatever, she evidently expected too much from that idiot.</p>
<p><em>Oy, what do you think of the old woman?</em> Jiaojiao prodded.</p>
<p><em>What is there to say? Isn&rsquo;t she being kind by combing your hair? She is simply doing her job as your servant.</em></p>
<p>Riiiight. <em>Sure hon. Whatever you say.</em></p>
<p>Cen Wei carefully, lovingly even, combed through the tangles of Jiaojiao&rsquo;s thin locks. Given malnutrition and lack of modern hair products, or any hair products really, the girl&rsquo;s hair wasn&rsquo;t in great condition. Jiaojiao grabbed a handful of split ends and grimaced. Nothing short of a haircut could save this mess, unfortunately, if the ancient standards of the world were consistent, then it would be considered an unfilial crime to cut ones hair.</p>
<p>Not that something like that was going to stop Jiaojiao from doing <em>what needed to be done.</em></p>
<p>Jiaojiao took another look at the face in the mirror. Cen Wei had started humming behind her, a cheerful tune that grated on her nerves and she did her best to ignore her. The face had potential, Jiaojiao admitted. The book author wasn&rsquo;t completely talking out of her ass when she described Bai Jing as a beauty to end all beauties. The bone structure was good, with delicate, high cheekbones, and underneath the mark, the skin was even in spite of the illusion given by the squiggling, veinlike marks.</p>
<p>Yes, she could work with this. Given her occupation, she would be embarrassed if she couldn&rsquo;t work with such material. Even if the little girl <em>had</em> been plain, it wouldn&rsquo;t have made a differences A good diet, some exercise&ndash; after that damned leg was fixed&ndash; and some make-up magic, what heart-stopping beauty couldn&rsquo;t she make?</p>
<p>Besides, the mark wasn&rsquo;t natural to begin with, not a birthmark as said in rumors, but a poison, courtesy of Head Wife Zhang. Some more inter-house drama she wasn&rsquo;t looking forward to navigating but&mldr;</p>
<p><em>What are you going to do about the poison?</em> Jiaojiao asked Guang Qiu in her head, prodding the mark. <em>Bai Jing had that magical inheritance to help her, but I don&rsquo;t have that, do I?</em></p>
<p>Guang Qiu paused, having realized he had overlooked yet another, very important detail.</p>
<p>*That&rsquo;s&mldr; Guang Qiu stalled, apparently at a loss.</p>
<p>She shook her head, wincing as Cen Wei&rsquo;s comb caught on a difficult knot.</p>
<p><em>I&rsquo;ll think of something.</em></p>
<p>Jiaojiao almost felt sorry for the dumb thing. It was clearly baling water out of a sinking ship.</p>
