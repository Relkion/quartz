<p>&ldquo;Why do you assume that I&rsquo;m lying? Because I&rsquo;m young? Or because I&rsquo;m a woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man threw back the rest of his cold tea and rose from his seat. &ldquo;Both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He indicated the door with his hand, a clear dismissal.</p>
<p>Jiaojiao leaned back on her hands, a smile that was not really a smile on her lips. &ldquo;There really is no shortage of fools in this world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man stopped, a hostile set to his shoulders, though his face remained genial. &ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I really were lying, it would be easy to prove right now. Why are you in such a rush to drive me away? Can it be a capable woman is so hard to tolerate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man laughed angrily. &ldquo;Good! Then we shall see if you are telling the truth, or if your mind is as ugly as your face!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao watched, expression mild as the man stalked out of the room indicating that she follow with a jerk of his head.</p>
<p>She took a leisurely hobble through the building into a study. The surroundings were tidy and though not rich, they were at least comfortable, with well maintained windows and clean floors. Sketches of weapons, namely swords and other knives, though there were spearheads as well, filled every surface, piled high up on the shelves and the desk without a care. The man swept an area clean with a brutish hand and slapped down a brush, an inkstone and an inkstick.</p>
<p>Jiaojiao rolled her eyes and prepared the ink herself, the man watching her movements with crossed arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems your master really trusts you if he lets you near the study,&rdquo; he observed, noting her fine movements. &ldquo;Look how practiced you ware. You must have spent many days grinding ink if you&rsquo;re so proficient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao was simply lamenting the difference in resources, the inkstick was of much better quality than the one she&rsquo;d used last night. She spent far less time grinding out enough pigment and soon started writing and sketching. The brush was like that of finest weasel hair and the ink emerged from it like butter.</p>
<p>Her hand flew and within a few minutes she blew on the ink to dry it and gave it to the man to peruse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; he asked, scowling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a schematic for another, simpler tool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao spent the next minute explaining how modern nail clippers worked in excessive detail. The man&rsquo;s expression grew brighter as the explanation went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ingenious,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;but this doesn&rsquo;t prove that you are the creator of that other schematic. The two are not in the same class of difficulty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I have nothing else to say,&rdquo; Jiaojiao smiled. &ldquo;Even the best doctor cannot cure a man who is willfully blind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you calling blind?!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heh.&rdquo; She rose from her seat at the low study table. Ancient furniture was such a pain in her leg. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t name names, if you identify as blind then that is your own problem. Anyway, It seems I will have to take my business elsewhere. Please, return my drawings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man scowled and reluctantly held the two papers out to her with soot-blackened hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can make it for you,&rdquo; he said at last, grudgingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know if I can afford such a great god as yourself. After all I am a mere woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your master&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is <em>myself</em>. I may be poor and humble&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guang Qiu scoffed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&ndash;but I am no one&rsquo;s servant.&rdquo; Jiaojiao threw the man a careless wave goodbye and began to leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive my disrespect!&rdquo; The man said his head dipped. &ldquo;I was too hasty to judge you by your appearance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what? Can you give me a discount? I&rsquo;m very poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can sell these schematics to me!&rdquo; The man proposed. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t cheat you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That depends on how much you offer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two sat down to discuss prices at the tea table, this time with a fresh pot of fine tea that tasted very much like Pu&rsquo;er. Jiaojiao sipped it with eyes narrowed in enjoyment. She wasn&rsquo;t much of a tea drinker&ndash;it caused too much teeth staining&ndash;but she was craving any taste that wasn&rsquo;t pickled vegetables, millet, or plain white rice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much are you willing to offer?&rdquo; Jiaojiao asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <em>lathe</em>, I do not understand its usage, can you explain it more clearly to me?&rdquo; the man coughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a machine to quickly and accurately shape many of the same parts at once. This particular lathe is only suitable for making one thing,&rdquo; Jiaojiao said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man hummed in thought. &ldquo;For jewelry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao nodded. &ldquo;This mechanism here is a way to adjust sizes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this unit?&rdquo; The man asked, pointing at a scale on the corner of the page. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not familiar with this <em>centimeter.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao didn&rsquo;t care for the ancient measurements of <em>cun</em> and <em>chi</em>. As for whether the centimeter measurement she&rsquo;d indicated was accurate, she had no true way of knowing. Unless a ruler transmigrated to her location.</p>
<p>Jiaojiao went on to have an involved discussion about the metric system, the man opposite her growing ever less skeptical of her as time grew on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you come up with this idea?&rdquo; he asked at last, after a conversation that spanned three cups of tea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m merely sharing information from my homeplan&ndash;err, hometown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao paused. <em>Guang Qiu, you&rsquo;re not concerned at all about me starting an industrial boom in this era?</em> she asked the ball, who was behaving uncharacteristically mild.</p>
<p><em>Will you listen if I say no, mortal? Don&rsquo;t do it. Please stop?</em> it asked.</p>
<p><em>Well. Do you want me to lie to you?</em></p>
<p>A distinct emotion of resigned irritation wafted from its direction before it went back to glowing dimly in her peripheral vision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss?&rdquo; the man asked, look at her in concern. &ldquo;What are you looking at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, I was just lost in thought. Have you decided how much you want to pay for the machine?&rdquo; Jiaojiao asked.</p>
<p>The man stroked his half-burnt beard. &ldquo;I will be honest with you, the potential for this machine is very big, but I have little use for a machine that can only make beads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can make it and sell it to others who do have a use for it. Artisans for example.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man sucked a breath through his teeth. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to say whether artisans would understand how to operate such a machine. They might even dislike it as a profanity toward tradition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao nodded. Such sentiments had risen during the industrial era as many traditional craftsman suffered lost of livelihood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides, it would take me a long time just to make one machine,&rdquo; the man complained. &ldquo;Even just one part of this machine might take me a whole day of forging. The most complex parts might even take me a week to make one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao listened to the man hem and haw, wise to his strategy. He wasn&rsquo;t wrong, per-say, but who knew what would happen to this blueprint after he got a hold of it? So what if he himself would take hours to forge one machine?</p>
<p>What if he hired many others to forge more machines? Did he really think Jiaojiao was an idiot? That she didn&rsquo;t realize that the blueprint was in fact, priceless?</p>
<p>Once one understood the mechanics, it wasn&rsquo;t difficult to adapt the lathe to make a variety of other parts. It was after all, the lathe that spawned the industrial revolution in her own world.</p>
<p>But Jiaojiao didn&rsquo;t care for impossible, far-flung dreams and hypotheticals. She just wanted to be comfortable <em>now</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give it to you for ten gold ingots, and a copy of the machine,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deal!&rdquo; the man smiled, looking very much like a greasy car salesman who had just closed a pyrrhic deal. Pyrrhic on the part of the customer, of course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it to me in silver. I don&rsquo;t want to have to go through the trouble of exchanging it after all,&rdquo; Jiaojiao added.</p>
<p>The man nodded agreeably and took a long sip of his tea.</p>
<p><em>He&rsquo;s obviously cheating you,</em> Guang Qiu said. <em>Why are you letting him take advantage?</em></p>
<p><em>So what? He thinks he has the better end of the deal, but who knows who will come out on top in the end,</em> Jiaojiao thought mysteriously. <em>Besides, it&rsquo;s not like I invented the lathe. I myself are merely appropriating someone else&rsquo;s invention. What right do I have to get proprietary?</em></p>
<p>Jiaojiao didn&rsquo;t believe it would be so easy to birth an industrial revolution. So what if she spread this core technology? It was just a single idea and only one contributing factor to an age of dreams, both hopeful and nightmarish.</p>
<p>This was the crux of the matter. To start an industrial boom needed an accumulation. An accumulation of knowledge, of resources, of time. An advance needed many great minds working together toward a single goal, and even then it might end in disappointment. It wasn&rsquo;t something a single girl could accomplish with a single idea.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, Jiaojiao hobbled into the front of the forge area, the tang of hot metal stung her nostrils. A handful of teenaged apprentices were working in the forge area, keeping the temperature in the blast furnace constant even while their master sipped tea.</p>
<p>Her sleeves and waist were heavy with coin. She was quite satisfied, but stopped short at the sight of a figure standing near the forges, complexion rapidly draining of blood.</p>
<p><em>Look!</em> Guang Qiu shot out, form blazing with light. <em>It&rsquo;s him!</em></p>
<p><em>Not this again,</em> Jiaojiao groaned, then turned away, <em>far away in the opposite direction.</em></p>
<p>Mo Wudi was standing in the yard. Why was Mo Wudi standing in the yard? Why was this creepy masked weirdo still around? <em>Why?</em></p>
<p><em>Where was he supposed to be during this part of the plot?</em> Jiaojiao muttered. <em>Wasn&rsquo;t Bai Jing still at the Bai estate? Hadn&rsquo;t he fixated on her by then and insisted on showing up in her surroundings unannounced?</em></p>
<p><em>But there&rsquo;s no Bai Jing now,</em> Guang Qiu said triumphantly, <em>which means he&rsquo;s free to turn up wherever the wind takes him! Including this place!</em></p>
<p>Jiaojiao wanted to bang her head on the nearest pillar and end all her troubles. Why must she meet this psycho on the road?</p>
<p><em>Go talk to him! Maybe he can help you retrieve the artifact!</em></p>
<p><em>Hehe, and maybe we&rsquo;ll ride a flying pig into a cotton candy sunset. Wake up! You still think he&rsquo;ll help us? For what reason? We are strangers! And I&rsquo;d like to keep it that way!</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xingyue.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>He&rsquo;s calling for you!</em> Guang Qiu squealed like a little fangirl at a k-pop concert.</p>
<p><em>My name isn&rsquo;t Bai Xingyue!</em> Jiaojiao roared in her mind, her staff and legs worked overtime as she retreated into the blacksmith&rsquo;s reception area.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing back here?&rdquo; The smith asked in surprise, on his way out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I met an ill omen and had to take a detour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heh! What can be more frightening than your face?&rdquo; the smith jested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haha, very funny, see how I laugh. Do you have a back exit to this place?&rdquo; Jiaojiao got a prickling sensation of deja vu.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has you frightened so?&rdquo; the smith asked in concern. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me there&rsquo;s really a ghost out there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only me,&rdquo; said a deep, magnetic voice. It brought to mind thunderstorms and chocolate.</p>
<p>Jiaojiao could see people objectively and appreciate them for their beauty even if she personally had no wish to get involved with them. Mo Wudi had a <em>very</em> nice voice.</p>
<p>She turned around, stiff, as if her waist were in the process of petrification. &ldquo;Hello. We meet again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The masked figure made a standard greeting salute, cupping his hands with perfect etiquette. His every nuanced movement like martial poetry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xingyue,&rdquo; he said, prompting the hairs to rise on the back of Jiaojiao&rsquo;s neck. &ldquo;We need to speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haha, what could we possibly have to speak about?&rdquo; Jiaojiao asked, perplexed, panicked, and perspiring. &ldquo;We have nothing to do with each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We indeed have nothing to do with each other,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Nevertheless, I still need to speak with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t need to speak with you,&rdquo; Jiaojiao edged away, her hand tight around her staff like a lifeline.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let her leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, master,&rdquo; the smith said, moving to block Jiaojiao&rsquo;s retreat with his considerable bulk.</p>
<p>Jiaojiao had a terrible thought.</p>
<p>Mo Wudi had four members in his inner circle, deputies in his <em>Abyss Syndicate</em>. One of them Dian Zhuo, happened to be a swarthy blacksmith. A gruff, but shrewd man who rivaled Doctor Tai in his pursuit of money, only he was far more successful in making it. Where Doctor Tai was half beggared with his failing clinic, Dian Zhuo was highly successful, owning a chain of smithies that spanned a third of Languo.</p>
<p><em>You still think you got a good deal?</em> Guang Qiu mocked.</p>
