<p>Jiaojiao tossed the shovel aside with revulsion and wiped her stinging hands on Cen Wei&rsquo;s gray robes, paying no mind to Guang Qiu&rsquo;s enraged screams ringing in her mind.</p>
<p><em>Mortal! Didn&rsquo;t I say not to get in conflict with the old woman? Why did you attack her, you imbecile?!</em></p>
<p><em>Sometimes I really do wonder if you have two brain cells to rub together, or whether you have braincells at all,</em> Jiaojiao retorted as she flipped the woman around with difficulty. She summoned all eighty-five pounds of leverage, sweat beading on her brow. <em>Perhaps you don&rsquo;t have a brain at all in that child&rsquo;s nightlight you call a body.</em></p>
<p><em>Now what will happen to the fateline?</em> Guang Qiu seemed to be mostly talking to itself. <em>It&rsquo;s already bad enough that the scene with Bai Xingwu didn&rsquo;t go as intended!</em></p>
<p>Jiaojiao rifled in the the woman&rsquo;s sleeves, but came up empty. <em>The bracelet isn&rsquo;t in her sleeves.</em> She informed Guang Qiu.</p>
<p>A small bout of distressed silence. <em>Then go look for it! Doesn&rsquo;t she live in the other hovel over there?</em></p>
<p><em>I can&rsquo;t just leave her here. What if she wakes up and comes after me?</em></p>
<p>Guang Qiu&rsquo;s grumbling reached a deafening crescendo as Jiaojiao ventured into the storehouse, the third building in the courtyard. She squinted in the low light of the setting sun and located a coil of moldy rope on a low shelf and sneezed when picking it up raised a small cloud of dust. Waving a hand in front of her face, she retreated with the heavy length of hemp rope, most likely reserved for roof repairs.</p>
<p>She spent the next ten to fifteen minutes securing Cen Wei&rsquo;s prone form, binding her arms close to her body and tying her legs together. She was thankful Bai Xingyue&rsquo;s courtyard was deserted, not knowing how she would explain herself should someone stumble onto the scene of her binding her unconscious servant.</p>
<p><em>This is not good,</em> Guang Qiu fretted. <em>What of the plot?</em></p>
<p><em>For real? You should just accept that the plot had been miscarried the moment you decided to yeet me into this body,</em> Jiaojiao said, tying off the last the rope and clapping the filth off her hands. <em>Besides, we would have had to make a move against her sooner or later.</em></p>
<p><em>I fail to see your reasoning. Bai Jing managed to keep an amiable relationship with the old woman, why couldn&rsquo;t you do the same?</em></p>
<p>Jiaojiao was once again reminded that Guang Qiu wasn&rsquo;t the most farsighted of beings. <em>My guess is that Cen Wei was always rotten, but when Bai Jing showed up, she frightened Cen Wei into hiding her true nature when she beat up Bai Xingwu.</em></p>
<p><em>So this is your fault!</em> The ball cried.</p>
<p><em>Hey, don&rsquo;t try to blame this on me. You&rsquo;re the one who put me here knowing I was but an &ldquo;entertainer,&rdquo; what exactly did you expect? That I would subdue them with my eyelash curlers?</em></p>
<p><em>I still think it would have been better to sneak into her room&ndash;</em></p>
<p><em>God, you just never quit! Even if I somehow managed to get the bracelet from her, what then? You saw her attitude. She would have likely detained us if we tried to leave. How would we get this leg fixed if we were confined to the courtyard? Even with the magic bracelet, I have no medical training. You expect me to fix this leg myself? And I highly doubt she would have been kind enough to invite a doctor. Besides&mldr; if my thoughts are correct&mldr;</em></p>
<p>Jiaojiao once again turned a deaf ear to Guang Qiu&rsquo;s complaints as she pushed open the door to the servant&rsquo;s quarters. She thought she would be met with more depressing sights of decrepitude and poverty, but she was surprised to find Cen Wei&rsquo;s room to be in good condition&ndash; at least compared to the rooms she&rsquo;d spend the day in.</p>
<p><em>Tsk, this old woman sure had double standards,</em> Jiaojiao laughed as she took in the fluffy covers on the servant&rsquo;s <em>kang</em>. They weren&rsquo;t silk, like the ones on Bai Xingyue&rsquo;s bed, but at least the cotton wasn&rsquo;t half-eaten by moths or damp with pond water. The space was simple, but the furniture was in good repair, with a minimal amount of wear. Though of simpler make than the furniture in Bai Xingyue&rsquo;s quarters, they were at least not on the verge of falling apart with a slight bump.</p>
<p>Bai Xingyue really had lived an unjust life. Even her servant lived better than her. The ceiling didn&rsquo;t even have as many missing roof tiles. Jiaojiao even wondered if Cen Wei had misappropriated some of her mistresses roofing tiles for her own abode.</p>
<p>The covers were turned over as Jiaojiao searched for the thing she suspected was secreted away by Cen Wei.</p>
<p><em>Found it,</em> Jiaojiao said with a smile.</p>
<p><em>Well done, mortal, you found the artifact?</em></p>
<p><em>No,</em> Jiaojiao held up the embroidered pouch, heavy and clinking in her hands. <em>Cash.</em></p>
<p><em>You imbecile, how can this mortal pittance compare with the magical space&ndash;</em></p>
<p><em>Hey idiot? Do you think doctors work for free? I&rsquo;m guessing subsidized healthcare isn&rsquo;t a thing here.</em></p>
<p>A sullen hum. <em>What of the artifact?</em></p>
<p>Jiaojiao turned over the rest of Cen Wei&rsquo;s items, but unfortunately the bracelet was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p><em>My guess is that the old woman pawned it this afternoon when she left. She really didn&rsquo;t waste any time. Some of the silver here is what she got in return,</em> Jiaojiao bounced the heavy pouch in her hands.</p>
<p><em>That old wretch! Now we have to waste more time tracking it down.</em> Guang Qiu cried. <em>I&rsquo;ve a mind to do away with her!</em></p>
<p>Jiaojiao smiled. <em>Do away?</em></p>
<p><em>Yes,</em> the ball said to itself. <em>If she remains, it will be more of a problem. Go on, you&rsquo;ve already done the damage when you decided to create a hostile relationship with her. Just go out and&mldr; hit her a few more times. You won&rsquo;t even have to risk your life.</em></p>
<p><em>I&rsquo;m not killing someone,</em> Jiaojiao said.</p>
<p><em>What?!</em> Guang Qiu drew back, as if the declaration against murder was somehow offensive. <em>What do you mean?</em></p>
<p><em>I&rsquo;m not a murderer,</em> Jiaojiao said. <em>You&rsquo;re not going to convince me to kill someone.</em></p>
<p><em>You already hit her, what difference does it make if you hit her again?</em></p>
<p><em>Uh, loads. I&rsquo;m not going to get into this debate with you.</em></p>
<p><em>This is a ridiculous conversation.</em></p>
<p><em>Wow! Something we can agree on!</em></p>
<p><em>If you hope to survive in this world, you will have to get over your squeamishness. You can&rsquo;t avoid killing forever. Bai Jing would have done it without even blinking.</em></p>
<p><em>I&rsquo;m getting really sick of hearing about Bai Jing. If she&rsquo;s so great, why isn&rsquo;t she here? Why am I stuck with her problems? Why am I stuck here with you?</em></p>
<p><em>Don&rsquo;t forget, mortal, I am the sole reason you live and breath! You cannot defy me!</em></p>
<p><em>Oh yeah? Go ahead, smite me. Just punish me for refusing to kill some defenseless old woman.</em></p>
<p>Guang Qiu didn&rsquo;t move.</p>
<p><em>You can&rsquo;t, can you? For all your blustering you can&rsquo;t do jack. If you could, you would have punished me already for not listening to you earlier.</em></p>
<p><em>Mortal&mldr;</em></p>
<p><em>This mortal doesn&rsquo;t have to do anything she doesn&rsquo;t want to. And she doesn&rsquo;t want to kill. So seriously, fuck off.</em></p>
<p><em>Mortal, you will think twice before crossing me!</em> The ball warned.</p>
<p><em>I already have. And I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re that much at all,</em> Jiaojiao scoffed. <em>You haven&rsquo;t done a thing to me since I woke up but scream at me to do things. And for what? With the threat of death? Newsflash, buddy! I&rsquo;m already dead!</em></p>
<p><em>You are alive right now.</em></p>
<p><em>No, I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;m fucking dead, and this is hell, with scenarios engineered just to torture me. No running water, no internet, no take-out, and everyone, EVERYONE, IS TRYING TO KILL ME.</em></p>
<p>Jiaojiao was tired of it. She prided herself on her composure, but enough was enough. She had used an outhouse for gods sake. She&rsquo;d touched a poo shovel with her bare hands. She&rsquo;d eaten worm food. She&rsquo;d even kowtowed today! What the hell was that?? She didn&rsquo;t know, but it wasn&rsquo;t living.</p>
<p><em>Besides, even if I do what you say, what&rsquo;s in it for me?</em> Jiaojiao shook her head. <em>Don&rsquo;t even try to con me with &ldquo;you get to live, mortal&rdquo; or some shit.</em></p>
<p>Guang Qiu vibrated, then fell silent.</p>
<p><em>I don&rsquo;t get anything out of listening to you, but more of this. And let me be real with you, it&rsquo;s not enough.</em></p>
<p><em>Then what do you want?</em></p>
<p>Bingo. <em>Well, is it possible for me to be sent back to my own worl&ndash;</em></p>
<p><em>Impossible!</em> The ball said immediately. <em>I don&rsquo;t have the power to do so.</em></p>
<p><em>That&rsquo;s going to be a tough sell for me, man.</em> Jiaojiao scoffed. <em>You pulled my soul over, don&rsquo;t tell me you can&rsquo;t send me back. I told you not to bullshit me.</em></p>
<p><em>You don&rsquo;t understand,</em> the ball explained irately. <em>The passage between worlds is usually closed. Even today was a very rare case when the celestial bodies aligned just so. It was enough for Bai Jing to slip through. When she didn&rsquo;t come, and the passage was moments from closing, we had to take measures to find a comparable soul to fill her place.</em></p>
<p><em>Comparable?</em> Jiaojiao pointed at herself. <em>You&rsquo;re saying me and Bai Jing are comparable? In what way?</em></p>
<p>Realizing he might have said too much, Guang Qiu hunkered down. <em>None of your business, mortal.</em></p>
<p><em>That&rsquo;s interesting,</em> Jiaojiao said. <em>That is to say there are souls of different calibers? What is the criteria? It can&rsquo;t be that an assassin and an&mldr; entertainer have much in common at all, yet you used the word comparable. Intriguing.</em></p>
<p><em>Stop thinking so much!</em></p>
<p>Jiaojiao began to think. What did she have in common with Bai Jing? Certainly, neither of them could be considered average people. They were both <em>intelligent, beautiful,</em> and influential young women, both famous in their own circles, both rich, both Chinese&ndash; though Jiaojiao only qualified by half, being a mix-breed with a Russian father. They were both skilled in their fields, though Guang Qiu would probably sneer to compare the art of blending foundation, to the art of the garrote.</p>
<p>Was that where the similarities ended? Not really.</p>
<p>For one, they both had an ancient ancestry, though the earthly Bai Family (again, not to be confused with the Bai Family of Lan country) bore a mystical background as ancient practitioners of medicine. The MEI conglomerate&rsquo;s origins were far more mundane. They were businessmen, or merchants to use the more archaic term, a social class that was at the very bottom in ancient China, often met with censure and derision. And this attitude had not changed until the last two centuries or so.</p>
<p>Then what were the differences? Not as much as the similarities anyway. Bai Jing had suffered from a childhood of abuse while Jiaojiao had been raised in the lap of luxury. This was the biggest difference between them, Jiaojiao thought. Bai Jing was used to suffering, and Jiaojiao, well. She was used to going with the path of least resistance. If there was an easier way, then that was the way she was going. Why suffer needlessly, after all?</p>
<p>If Jiaojiao had to put it crudely, they were both one in a million in terms of their life experiences.</p>
<p>In other words, people like them didn&rsquo;t just die everyday.</p>
<p><em>How did I die, Guang Qiu?</em> Jiaojiao asked.</p>
<p><em>&mldr;I believe it&rsquo;s called carbon monoxide poisoning, in your world.</em></p>
<p><em>Of all the dumb&mldr;</em> Jiaojiao trailed off didn&rsquo;t speak for a long, long time. <em>Did anyone else die in the same incident that I did?</em></p>
<p><em>Why does this matt&ndash;</em></p>
<p><em>Just tell me!</em></p>
<p>Guang Qiu drew back at her vehemence <em>What!? How should I know? I grabbed the first soul I saw that could be used, I didn&rsquo;t stop to look around!</em></p>
<p>Jiaojiao kept a hand at her neck, hand habitually grasping for something that wasn&rsquo;t there. She frowned, deep in thought. Where did that leave her? If Devika was dead, then why did she get to live? What made her so worthy? Was the world really this unfair?</p>
<p><em>Who&rsquo;s Devika?</em> Guang Qiu asked.</p>
<p>Jiaojiao glared. <em>I thought you couldn&rsquo;t hear my thoughts.</em></p>
<p><em>You were thinking too loudly,</em> Guang Qiu said disdainfully. <em>Don&rsquo;t presume to think I would eavesdrop. Why would I stoop so low just to have a peek at a mere mortal&rsquo;s thoughts?</em></p>
<p><em>She&rsquo;s my roommate,</em> Jiaojiao explained shortly. <em>If what you said is right, then she&rsquo;s probably dead too.</em></p>
<p>Carbon monoxide was colorless, tasteless, and the only symptoms that would generally manifest were dizziness, headaches and an upset stomach. No wonder she hadn&rsquo;t seen it coming. She&rsquo;d merely blown it off as a flu.</p>
<p><em>Mortals. So fragile,</em> Guang Qiu said in liu of sympathy. <em>Don&rsquo;t take it so hard, she would have been dead in a mere fifty to sixty years anyway.</em></p>
<p><em>As if fifty years is a trivial sampling of time!</em></p>
<p><em>It is for me,</em> Guang Qiu said loftily.</p>
<p>Jiaojiao shook her head. She was asking too much if she thought this dumb ball could be understanding.</p>
<p><em>I have something I want, but I don&rsquo;t know if you can give it to me,</em> Jiaojiao said finally.</p>
<p><em>What?</em> The ball vibrated in impatience.</p>
<p><em>If you can bring me back to life, then you can bring others back to life too, correct?</em></p>
<p><em>Absolutely not!</em> The ball cried, it&rsquo;s shape fuzzy and spiked with agitation. <em>You think this is a game? I won&rsquo;t do it, you can just give up that fanciful dream this instant!</em></p>
<p><em>What&rsquo;s the matter?</em> Jiaojiao crossed her arms. <em>You resurrected me just fine. What&rsquo;s stopping you from doing it again for someone else?</em></p>
<p><em>I wouldn&rsquo;t have bothered to do so if I were not compelled by extenuating circumstances! You think the cycle of reincarnation can just to flouted at a mortal&rsquo;s whim?</em></p>
<p><em>Then I guess we have nothing to talk about,</em> Jiaojiao said. Her eyes were dark as she left the irate Guang Qiu to hobble into the darkened courtyard.</p>
