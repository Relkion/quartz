<p>&ldquo;Hand over all your money!&rdquo; the boy said, pressing the dagger against her neck. His face was stoic, but his voice was young and trembling.</p>
<p>Jiaojiao shifted away from the cold steel, but it followed her, close as a shadow. A prick announced that the knife had broken skin. The young rickshaw driver&rsquo;s face, tense and drawn with adrenaline jerked at the sight of blood trickling down her neck.</p>
<p><em>What luck. I&rsquo;ve conned a sum out of that pawnshop and now it&rsquo;s my turn.</em></p>
<p><em>There is a thing such as karma,</em> Guang Qiu said smugly.</p>
<p>It would be the smart thing to do, to hand over the money, but Jiaojiao was tired of the universe trampling over her. First she&rsquo;d been downloaded into this ruin of a body, then she&rsquo;d had to deal with Cen Wei, that sadistic servant feeding her garbage among other things. She&rsquo;d had her leg broken this morning. She&rsquo;d nearly had a heart attack being embraced by Mo Wudi, that psycho. She&rsquo;d been dealing with Guang Qiu&rsquo;s non-stop nagging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m done,&rdquo; Jiaojiao announced to the world at large. &ldquo;If this is where I die, so be it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear me?&rdquo; the boy gestured with his free hand, &ldquo;give me all your money!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao&rsquo;s eyes caught on a long jagged scar on his left forearm and fell deep into thought.</p>
<p><em>What are you waiting for?</em> Guang Qiu said nervously. <em>If you don&rsquo;t give him the money then you really will die.</em></p>
<p><em>What are the chances that I meet three new characters in the book all in one day?</em> Jiaojiao asked.</p>
<p>Guang Qiu paused. <em>I only count two, Mo Wudi and Doctor Tai. Who else?</em></p>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s three. If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, this young man is Tu Wenfeng,</em></p>
<p><em>Ah! He has the same scar! You might be right!</em> Guang Qiu vibrated with agitation. <em>But how can this be? Shouldn&rsquo;t he only appear in chapter thirty? We haven&rsquo;t even reached chapter three yet in terms of time passage! This is no good! The chronology is a mess!</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this bullying the infirm?&rdquo; Jiaojiao tsked. &ldquo;You should be ashamed of yourself. Robbing the sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy turned red, though his expression didn&rsquo;t change. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but I have a very important use for this money.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Say, he&rsquo;s blushing from shame. Why does this seem very different from the Tu Wenfeng in the book? Wasn&rsquo;t this guy supposed to be a merciless thief and killer?</em></p>
<p>This seemed to set Guang Qiu at ease. <em>Maybe you&rsquo;re mistaken and this isn&rsquo;t Tu Wenfeng after all.</em></p>
<p><em>I don&rsquo;t know. Perhaps something happened between now and chapter 30 that caused his personality to undergo a change.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Important enough to cast your morals to the wayside?&rdquo; Jiaojiao asked the boy. &ldquo;You are strong and able-bodied, what is it that&rsquo;s keeping you from earning the money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have the time. Please just give me the money, I don&rsquo;t want to hurt you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every thief in the world thinks they have a better use for the money they steal than those they&rsquo;re stealing from,&rdquo; Jiaojiao shook her head. &ldquo;You think you&rsquo;re desperate enough to kill, then go ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Mortal, are you stupid? Why are you provoking him?</em></p>
<p><em>Relax, if he had the guts to kill me for this bit of change, then he would have slit my throat instead of trying to negotiate. Honestly, who says &ldquo;please&rdquo; to the people they&rsquo;re robbing?</em></p>
<p>Having decided that he&rsquo;d waited long enough, Tu Wenfeng&rsquo;s feet shifted as he stepped in closer, reaching toward Jiaojiao&rsquo;s sleeve where she kept the coin pouch. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t resist, I know your leg is injured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao suddenly jerked up the staff resting on her knees and knocked his knife away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; the boy cursed and bent down to scrabble for the knife on the dirty alley floor.</p>
<p>Jiaojiao didn&rsquo;t budge from her seat, because really, how far would she get with her leg? She rest her chin in her hand as she lounged against the side of the rickshaw, watching the boy spring up with the retrieved dagger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you tell me more about what you need the money for? Maybe if you move me with your sincerity, I&rsquo;ll give it to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy hesitated, fingering the dagger with shaking hands. &ldquo;What if you decide you don&rsquo;t want to give the money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we can fight it out! Cripple to rickshaw driver!&rdquo; she tapped her bad leg. &ldquo;What are you worried about? It&rsquo;s not like I can run away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy bowed his head. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a girl&mldr;&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Jesus, spare me. Why is it always a girl?</em> Jiaojiao clicked her tongue. &ldquo;And what? You hope to gather enough riches to impress her and you can go riding into the sunset together and live happily ever after?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy turned a vivid, bruised, red. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? Just because you have a girl you like, you can rob whoever you like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t gather enough money to redeem her, she will become a brothel worker. She comes of age in a month. I don&rsquo;t have the time to be earning coppers when buying her would cost fifty silver taels.&rdquo; The boy turned a frustrated look the rickshaw.</p>
<p><em>Uhhh&mldr; was this part of his backstory?</em> Jiaojiao asked Guang Qiu. <em>This is why he became an amoral mercenary? He lost his little lover to a brothel? Why wasn&rsquo;t this in the book?</em></p>
<p><em>I&rsquo;m not sure. The book can&rsquo;t include every little thing that happens to every character or the author would never rest!</em></p>
<p><em>I suppose you have a point. Speaking of which, why is a webnovel written by some middle schooler dictating the events in your world anyway?</em></p>
<p><em>Hehe, trying to get more information from me?</em> Guang Qiu mocked. <em>Keep dreaming, mortal.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have fifty taels on me,&rdquo; Jiaojiao confessed. &ldquo;Even if you rob me, you&rsquo;ll have to go on to rob others, unless of course you happen to have the difference on you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy looked on eyes wide, as Jiaojiao shook out her sleeves into her lap and began counting change. &ldquo;I have fifteen taels, how much do you have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;I&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao clapped her hands, eyes sparkling. &ldquo;That gives me an idea! I have a business proposition for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;W-what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, I&rsquo;m not exactly rich either, but I have ways to make money. Unfortunately, I can&rsquo;t do much with my body the way it is. I need someone who can act for me. I can supply the ideas while you do the rough work. Deal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of ideas?&rdquo; the boy asked, interest piqued.</p>
<p><em>What do you think you&rsquo;re doing?!</em> Guang Qiu roared. <em>What nonsense! Just give him the money and leave! You shouldn&rsquo;t even be talking to him!</em></p>
<p><em>Oh, spare me. What do you think will happen when he finishes robbing me? You think he would be kind enough to drop me off at the Bai Estate?</em></p>
<p>Guang Qiu choked.</p>
<p><em>Exactly, I&rsquo;ll be stranded in this alley with no money and no way to get home! I might as well toss all my chips in and hope for the best!</em></p>
<p><em>He seems like an agreeable young man, perhaps if you ask nicely&ndash;</em></p>
<p><em>No way! I already owe Hu Maoxun, like, ten taels of silver!</em> Jiaojiao shot Guang Qiu a sharp look. <em>Haven&rsquo;t you heard that debt is the slavery of the free? I absolutely can&rsquo;t abide being in debt. You know what my biggest problem is?</em></p>
<p><em>That you&rsquo;ve lost the artifact?</em></p>
<p>*Idiot! It&rsquo;s money! So what if Bai Xingwu has the artifact, right?</p>
<p><em>Right?</em></p>
<p><em>So, how do I get it back from her? Because realistically, do you think this body, with my soul, is capable of sneaking into her courtyard and past all the guards and whatever servants she has?</em></p>
<p><em>You&mldr; you&mldr;</em> Guang Qiu dimmed. <em>What then?</em></p>
<p><em>If I had money, I could just hire someone to steal it back from her!</em></p>
<p><em>Hah! Good luck! With the Bai Family&rsquo;s reputation, you think anyone would be willing to cross them for some pocket change?</em></p>
<p><em>You&rsquo;re thinking too simply. The Bai family is powerful, but that just means they have powerful enemies. Besides, you think the people in the Jianghu care about things like social status? Wasn&rsquo;t Bai Jing able to find a lot of helpers there who didn&rsquo;t give a crap about the Bai family?</em></p>
<p>Guang Qiu chewed on this for a minute. <em>I suppose you have a point.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello? Miss? Are you alright? What are you looking at?&rdquo; Tu Wenfeng asked, peering at the empty air where Guang Qiu floated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, I&rsquo;m just thinking,&rdquo; Jiaojiao said. &ldquo;As for ideas, I can name a few. Are there many tanneries in the capital?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s at least ten,&rdquo; Tu Wenfeng answered. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; Jiaojiao smiled.</p>
<p>Tu Wenfeng stared at her skeptically, his grasp on the dagger tightening ominously.</p>
<p><em>Looks like you couldn&rsquo;t convince him,</em> Guang Qiu sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t believe me, take me to a place you can keep me secured. It&rsquo;s not like it would be hard to keep me from running away. Like your house,&rdquo; Jiaojiao paused. &ldquo;You do have a house, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;M-my house? You want to go to my house?&rdquo; the boy drew back as he were a child at a park and Jiaojiao was some creepy weirdo with an iconic white van.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y-you&rsquo;re a young girl, shouldn&rsquo;t you be more mindful of propriety?&rdquo; the boy looked away, cheeks flaming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, are you saying I can&rsquo;t trust you, or that you can&rsquo;t trust me?&rdquo; Jiaojiao gave Tu Wenfeng a mocking stare. &ldquo;What are you worried about? That this cripple will take advantage of you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking as if he thought he was doing something very stupid, the boy hesitantly sheathed his dagger and took up the two posts at the front of the rickshaw. He glanced back a Jiaojiao a few times before shaking his head and taking off in a brisk jog.</p>
<p><em>You&rsquo;ve done it. You&rsquo;ve managed to con him. This makes your second victim of the day,</em> Guang Qiu said, half-stunned, half-reproachful.</p>
<p><em>Why do you think it&rsquo;s a con? I&rsquo;m very serious about this. I never joke about money,</em> Jiaojiao leaned back in the rickshaw shifting her numb ass.</p>
<p><em>What can you possibly do to earn money?</em> Guang Qiu asked with a skeptical hum. <em>You think starting a business is easy? I&rsquo;m not an expert at the affairs of mortals but even I know that this is far from a simple endeavor&ndash;</em> a pause *&ndash;or are you simply out to run another scam? Even scams aren&rsquo;t easy to pull off&ndash;</p>
<p><em>Would you quit calling me a scammer?</em></p>
<p>The two bickered to pass the time. The rickshaw passed over a wide bridge with three lanes of traffic, two for carts and one for pedestrians. A uniformed guard dressed in layered leather armor and a dark blue uniform gestured back and forth, directing traffic and scolding those that veered out of their lane. Jiaojiao held her nose at the foul smell as they passed over the water. With no modern sanitation and hygeine, the river flowing through the city was an awful green.</p>
<p>There was a change in scenery on the opposite side of the canal. Soon Jiaojiao noticed their surroundings were becoming ever more dull and depressed. Run-down shanties and collapsed wooden structures lined the streets. A beggar crouched by the side of the road, his leg oozing with pus and sores. He held a wooden bowl out to Jiaojiao as the rickshaw passed, but Tu Wenfeng sped up and the beggar was left in the dust. Skinny children sat in doorways, or ran naked in the streets, women with tired faces crouched over basins of cloudy water, washing garments by hand.</p>
<p>Tu Wenfeng didn&rsquo;t pause to let Jiaojiao take in the sights, seeming to speed up more and more the nearer he got to his destination. At last, they slowed and came to a stop outside a dingy compound that looked like a wooden cousin to Bai Xingyue&rsquo;s courtyard. A gaggle of dirty-faced children burst out of the entryway and crowded around Tu Wenfeng. Seemingly a thousand young voices called out at once, asking who is this girl?</p>
<p>Tu Wenfeng turn toward Jiaojiao, two children hanging from his neck. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;</p>
