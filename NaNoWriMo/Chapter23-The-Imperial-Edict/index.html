<p>Jiaojiao trailed after Bai Qinghan, the heavy oak doors closing on her staggering heels as she limped after the irate man. He did not speak to her, merely rushing forward through the entryway and the courtyard. Jiaojiao admired the architeture and selection of garden plants, the cleanly swept pathways, blue and gray robed servants watching them wide-eyed, pausing in their duties to ogle them discreetly as they passed.</p>
<p>The distance between them grew the longer the journey went on, Jiaojiao&rsquo;s exaggerated staggers unable to keep up with Bai Qinghan&rsquo;s long-legged gait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, wait for me! she called.</p>
<p>Bai Qinghan gave an impatient snort and a guard darted out from an unknown location to sweep her up by the elbows. His face grimaced in disgust at her beggared countenance.</p>
<p>Jiaojiao was startled, but managed not to give up the ruse, flailing only briefly before allowing herself to be carried bodily under the arms like a toddler. The guard kept her at arms length, not allowing a single fold of her robe to brush his polished black leather armor.</p>
<p>The scenery flew by until the guard deposited her on the floor of a study at Bai Qinghan&rsquo;s feet. Jiaojiao looked up into cold, black eyes.</p>
<p>Bai Qinghan was a handsome specimen, standing tall at around six feet, towering over Jiaojiao&rsquo;s petite five foot flat. Bai Xingyue after all, wasn&rsquo;t much taller than a child, having been denied proper nutrition for much of her life. Jiaojiao capitalized on this apparent discrepancy, cowering beneath her &ldquo;father"s shadow as he loomed over her, face black like charcoal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think you&rsquo;re doing?&rdquo; he said, voice like a dangling icicle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; Jiaojiao sniffled, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I was just worried for mother&rsquo;s bracelet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a disgrace! Do you know what the capital will be saying about the Bai house after that stunt at the gates? What they will think of us? What they will think of me?&rdquo; he thundered his hand rose and fell. A streak of brown energy shot out of his palm, obliterating a nearby tea-table into shards of wood and shattered porcelain. Jiaojiao shielded her face as debris pelted her body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;F-father! Please don&rsquo;t be angry!&rdquo; Jiaojiao didn&rsquo;t need to fake the tremor in her shoulders this time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should break your leg again for this insolence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Qinghan raised his hand again. Just as Jiaojiao was certain she would be making another visit to Doctor Tai, the scuffing sound of running footsteps came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; a servant bowed low, sleeved hands folded in front of him. &ldquo;A messenger has come from the palace!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao discreetly brushed the shards of wood from her body as Bai Qinghan scowled fiercely at the interruption. &ldquo;What do they want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are carrying an imperial edict. They have summoned the Bai family descendants to receive it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Qinghan spared Jiaojiao a disgusted glance. &ldquo;All of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They said all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well. See to it that he is properly entertained while the children are summoned. And get this&mldr; cleaned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao was once again hoisted up and ushered into another room, this time to have the living daylights scrubbed out of her and shoved into a fine silk robe. Her hair was nearly ripped from her scalp as a careless maid tamed it into a neat braid. Jiaojiao should have been happy, all the amenities, the soap was of a fine floral scent and soft like butter, the robe the softest material she&rsquo;d felt since transmigrating, but the attitudes of the servants attending her were careless and even spiteful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heh, all that finery, and still ugly,&rdquo; one muttered. The rest tittered in response, then escorted her to the main hall where the other Bai children were waiting.</p>
<p>Though to call them children was inaccurate, they were after all all teenaged to adult in years, and all called Bai Qinghan father.</p>
<p>The Bai family used the naming convention of using the first character of a child&rsquo;s given name the same as all others in their generation, hence every child was named &ldquo;<em>Xing</em>&rdquo; something.</p>
<p>Jiaojiao counted off the faces in the hall, trying to put names to them from her knowledge of the text. All of them were tall and beautiful, with sharp, dark eyes like their father.</p>
<p><em>How annoying,</em> Jiaojiao complained. <em>The poor servants must be on their last braincell, trying not to get them confused.</em></p>
<p>Bai Xingfei, the eldest male at twenty-five years old, was not present, as he had been long recruited into a reputable sect after displaying extraordinary martial talent. Given his abilities, he was likely to be given an important position in the sect and therefore not suitable for family heir. <em>Bai Xing Series One,</em> Jiaojiao thought, ticking off the name in her head.</p>
<p>Bai Xing Series Two, or Bai Xingguang, the second eldest at age twenty, also male, was the unofficial family heir. Given that his martial talent was far inferior to his elder brother, he did not have much hope to advance beyond the martial apprentice realm. He gave Jiaojiao a strange look when she came in, scanning her from head to toe and giving her a nasty smirk. Jiaojiao felt an uncomfortable lurch in her stomach as his eyes fell on her and she frowned, holding her middle.</p>
<p>Jiaojiao shook her head and moved on to the next in line. Bai Xing Series Three, Bai Xing Juan, eldest daughter. She too was talented at martial arts, having already reached martial master at age sixteen. However, because she was female, she didn&rsquo;t have much hope to travel further on that road without a sect backing her. In the book, she often clashed with Bai Jing, being the number one candidate to replace Bai Xingyue&rsquo;s position as the Crown Prince&rsquo;s fiance.</p>
<p>Bai Xing Series Four, was Bai Xingyue, whose body was currently being worn by Jiaojiao. At age fifteen, she should have undergone her hair-pinning ceremony a month ago, however, the day and come and gone without a soul remembering. Jiaojiao sent out a silent prayer to the departed soul, despite being an atheist. As a martial cripple, and literal cripple, she was lowliest of the Bai children and scorned by the entire capital as a waste, especially given her status as the de facto future empress to the realm.</p>
<p>Bai Xing Series Five, was Bai Xingwu, the only one Jiaojiao had the pleasure of meeting prior to this summoning. The girl shot an angry glare at Jiaojiao, looking for all the world like she was ready to beat her face in and finish the job she&rsquo;d abandoned a few days ago. Jiaojiao gave her a tiny wave and a smile before taking her place next to her. The girl gave her a disbelieving look before looking away with a snort. &ldquo;Did she become a lunatic as as well as a beggar?&rdquo; she mocked under her breath.</p>
<p>The imperial envoy standing in the center of the hall coughed and opened his mouth to speak when rapid steps came from the double doors. A harried youth hurried in, nodding to the other Bai children, including Jiaojiao become coming to stand beside her. Jiaojiao gave him a strange look. She recognized him as the same boy who had given Hu Maoxun the bag of silvers the day she&rsquo;d left the estate.</p>
<p><em>Who is this?</em> she asked Guang Qiu.</p>
<p><em>He must be a son of the Bai family if he&rsquo;s here for the edict.</em></p>
<p><em>Well, no shit? Why is there no mention of him in the book?</em></p>
<p>Guang Qiu made a humming noise. <em>He must not have been important enough to mention? So many things have been broken beyond repair since</em> you&rsquo;ve <em>meddled. After all, this scene happened differently too.</em></p>
<p>In the book, the imperial envoy had come to the estate as well, but it was to annul the marriage between Bai Xingyue and the crown prince. Judging by the line-up, the purpose of this visit was entirely different.</p>
<p>The envoy gave the boy a questioning glance. &ldquo;You are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xingyun,&rdquo;&rdquo; the boy said. &ldquo;This humble one is the third son of Official Bai.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The envoy nodded then unfurled the fine vellum scroll with a flourish. &ldquo;To see the imperial edict, is the see the emperor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other Bai children fell to their knees. Jiaojiao was a beat too slow and Bai Xingyun gave her a worried look before tugging her down with him by the sleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the third day of the <em>Kui</em> month of the Six-hundred-fifty-sixth year of <em>Meng</em>&mldr; the Royal Hunt is to commence at the Imperial Hunting Grounds. All the younger generation of the Bai family of the ages between thirteen and twenty-five are to attend! Rise to receive the edict!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xingguang rose from his one-kneed crouch to receive the scroll with both hands. The envoy gave a standard farewell salute before turning to leave, brushing aside Bai Qinghan&rsquo;s invitations to stay with polite deflections. The two disappeared from view, leaving the Bai children to themselves in the wide hall.</p>
<p><em>What are they thinking inviting this cripple to a hunt? Whoever wrote that edict has a bad sense of humor.</em></p>
<p>Jiaojiao rose from her knees, throwing a bit of side-eye at the boy. If she&rsquo;d still been a cripple, that tug might have sent her face-planting on the fine goat-hair rug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; Bai Xingwu said, similarly rising. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised you have the face to come back! I think you would suit the life of a beggar! After all, that face&mldr; really brings ones sympathy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao gave Bai Xingwu a polite smile. &ldquo;Sister, may I have my mother&rsquo;s bracelet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What nonsense are you speaking?&rdquo; Bai Xingwu spat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That bracelet on your wrist is my mother&rsquo;s memento. My servant pawned it to the Red Treasure. When I went to get it back, they said the third young miss of the Bai family bought it&mldr;&rdquo; Jiaojiao gave a delicate pause. &ldquo;&mldr;forcefully against store policy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xingwu&rsquo;s brows drew up so fast they might have been strapped to rockets. She held slapped her hand to her wrist. &ldquo;What?! This is your bracelet?!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao sniffled. &ldquo;Does it disgust you to know I wore it? That it lay against my skin? Aiya, what if&mldr; what if you grow a red mark on your face too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xingwu growled and ripped the bracelet from her wrist. &ldquo;Disgusting! I will peel the skin from my wrist if I could!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao held out her hand. &ldquo;Sister, will you give me my mother&rsquo;s memento?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heh!&rdquo; Bai Xingwu&rsquo;s smile grew sharp. &ldquo;Even if I don&rsquo;t want it, you&rsquo;re dreaming if you think I&rsquo;ll just give it back!&rdquo; With a swish of her pink robes, she turned to leave.</p>
<p>Jiaojiao limped after her, calling, &ldquo;Third Sister! Wait!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other children watched the event without intervening. Bai Jing&rsquo;s eyes bored, while Bai Xingguang had a strange, twisted expression on his lips. Jiaojiao&rsquo;s stomach gave another lurch as she caught sight of it.</p>
<p>Bai Xingwu stopped next to a lotus pond. She waited until Jiaojiao caught up to her before flashing a brilliant grin. Her face was light and airy with joy. The golden wood bracelet lay on the girl&rsquo;s white palm, exquisite and delicate carvings of lifelike flowers and greenery shimmered in the sunlight..</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want the bracelet?&rdquo; she said sweetly. &ldquo;Then you can swim for it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bracelet disappeared with a plop into the waters, with scarely a ripple. Bai Xingwu gave a sweet laugh before sauntering away.</p>
<p><em>Now what?</em> Jiaojiao thought, looking down at the green waters of the lotus pond. <em>I know how to swim, but I&rsquo;d be an idiot to try in broad daylight.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;I can help you get it,&rdquo; said a voice. Jiaojiao turned to see Bai Xingyun, the same boy that had tugged her to the ground in the hall.</p>
<p>Jiaojiao stared at the boy in thought. <em>Guang Qiu, did Bai Xingyue know this boy?</em></p>
<p><em>How should I know?</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Why would you help me?&rdquo; Jiaojiao asked.</p>
<p>The boy shrugged and kicked off his cloth shoes, rolling up his sleeves and pant-legs, and tucking his robes into his belt.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t answer Jiaojiao, simply wading into the pond with a splash. It wasn&rsquo;t very deep, scarcely above his knees, but the ends of his robes still ended up soaked despite his precautions.</p>
<p>He looked for all the world like a peasant wading in a rice paddy, despite his fine robes and polished bone hair pin, stark and brilliant against his ink hair.</p>
<p>Jiaojiao sat in the shade of a nearby pear tree as she waited for the boy to finish his quest. His eyes lit up a few minutes later, his hands coming out of the water with the bracelet and a handful of soft, yellow mud. He thoughtfully washed the bracelet before handing it back to Jiaojiao with a sheepish smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xingyue,&rdquo; said a male voice in a peculiar tone.</p>
<p>The two by the pond looked up from their exchange to see Bai Xingguang standing on the path. His face bright with delight in the setting sun as he tapped the vellum scroll against his neck. Unwittingly, the day had passed.</p>
<p>Jiaojiao stood slowly as the young man strolled closer. Bai Xingyun stepped forward to intercept Bai Xingguang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you taken a liking to the little cripple?&rdquo; asked Bai Xingguang with a laugh. &ldquo;Though, I suppose two cripples would have a lot to talk about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xingyun bowed his head and cupped his hands. &ldquo;Brother, please don&rsquo;t be like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xingguang strolled around Bai Xingyun, shoulder checking the teenager hard enough to make him stumble. &ldquo;Know your place, servant. You may have the blood of the Bai family in you, but your lowly blood can&rsquo;t be washed out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao&rsquo;s heart started a frenetic, pace in her chest. Her breath came in short gasps as Bai Xingguang came close enough to breathe on her, hand coming up to pinch her chin, hard enough to bruise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao clutched her chest with a shaking hand, soundless words came and went, leaving aborted gasps to puff out of her trembling lips. What was happening with her? Why was her body&mldr;</p>
<p>Bai Xingguang laughed, low and suggestive. He withdrew his hand and turned away, leaving only the lingering trace of myrrh and incense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xingyue, are you hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao couldn&rsquo;t speak. She couldn&rsquo;t breathe. Her heart a malfunctioning engine running too fast.</p>
<p>The teenaged boy took her by the sleeve and tugged her away from the pond. Jiaojiao caught sight of his worried eyes, but couldn&rsquo;t resist, barely able to think. She was led down a meandering path, the dying sun threw stark shadows, confused and myriad. Hushed voices whispered as they passed.</p>
<p><em>What&rsquo;s happening?</em> she asked Guang Qiu, her minds voice sounded like it passed through several distortion filters.</p>
<p>The ball didn&rsquo;t answer. It couldn&rsquo;t even be seen hovering nearby. When had it left?</p>
<p>The next Jiaojiao knew, she was in a courtyard, both familiar and strange in the low, crimson light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aiya!&rdquo; came the high voice of an old woman. &ldquo;Yueyue! You&rsquo;re back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiaojiao started, shook her head, confused shapes still dogging her mind. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave me here with her,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>The boy frowned, but still let go of her sleeve. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be fine,&rdquo; he said, before leaving her with a head like a raging monsoon. Invisible winds seemed to lash at her from the inside as she watched, dazed, the old woman come closer and take her by the hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nanny Cen,&rdquo; Jiaojiao rasped, eyes like fog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yueyue, I missed you,&rdquo; the old woman said with tears in her eyes. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re finally home.&rdquo;</p>
