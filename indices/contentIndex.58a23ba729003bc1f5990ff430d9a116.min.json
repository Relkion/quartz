From the scuffed corners of the _hongmu_ armoire, to the cracked surface of the low tea table with mother of pearl inlay, every detail screamed of bygone grandeur. The mustiness in the air hinted at age and neglect.\n\nJIaojiao didn't react for a good ten seconds, staring here and there at the ratty paper windows, thrice mended and patched with ragged bits of cloth, at the exposed brown bricks beyond the cracked lime plaster, at the moth eaten covers over her too-small lap. She held up her bony hands, chapped, with yellowed uneven nails.\n\n\"Oh no,\" Jiaojiao spoke aloud. \"I'm having a stroke.\"\n\nBecause, that could be the only explanation for this... this farce of a hallucination, right? She had only just been arguing with... who was it? Right, Superb_Ninja2394, defending her controversial decision to pair Galaxy Sunrise nail polish with hot pink stripes and gold decals. Why else would she be seeing this scene out of a half-baked period drama. It was a stroke.\n\nA stroke. It had to be.\n\nBecause... what would be the alternative?\n\nWith mounting horror, Jiaojiao used her not-her-hands to touch her not-her-face. It was small, thin, and _unmoisturized_. _Who was this person?_\n\nShe didn't get to dwell on it further before the door to the bedroom burst open with a crack of distressed wood.\n\n\"Bai Xingyue, you slut!\" cried a sweet young voice.\n\nFramed in the doorway, with her leg still raised in a high-kick, was a young girl in a pink _hanfu_, perhaps twelve to fifteen years old. Pearled hairpins in the shapes of flowers and birds swayed with her movements. Her tender face was scrunched in a scowl that was more cute in the way of angry kittens and growling puppies, than intimidating.\n\nBai Xingyue? Is she talking about _not-me_?\n\nThe girl didn't waste a second rushing into the room, hand raised in a maneuver Jiaojiao recognized well as the classic posture for a slap, so well exemplified in Chinese harem dramas. She shifted out of the way, though her body responded much more sluggishly than she was used to.\n\nThe angry girl's pink embroidered sleeves billowed as her fist landed on the traditional _kang_ bed. Rather than bouncing off the woven bottom as Jiaojiao expected, that tiny palm blasted through in an explosion of bamboo shards.\n\n\"You dare dodge?!\" The girl screeched, then pouted at the _audacity_.\n\nJiaojiao was too baffled to speak. What then? So should she stay still and get her head smashed in? The hell was with this strength? Was this ninety pound loli She-ra incarnate?\n\n\"I-- I'm sorry?\" Jiaojiao finally rasped out, noting that the voice was not her voice, but what else was new? The moment the words were out of her-- _not-her mouth_, there was a brief buzz in Jiaojiao's mind. Jiaojiao frowned, raising a hand to her head. More signs she was having a stroke, surely.\n\n\"You think apologizing is enough?\" the girl sneered, hand raised for another slap. \"You slut. Why didn't you just drown in that pond?¬†You think such lowly tactics would attract the crown prince? Naive!\"\n\n*What was this about a crown prince? So this is a historical drama? What dynasty? Is this a drama with wuxia elements?* Jiaojiao thought wildly to herself. How else to explain this girls strength? Her mind swiftly ran the gamut of routine hypotheticals. *Is this a movie set? Am I getting punked? Where are the cameras? Where is the crew? Is this a dream? Why am I even thinking about this? I could be dying right as we speak, brain cells withering from lack of oxygen! Are the paramedics even on the way?* Knowing her usual audience they wouldn't care to call for help even if it became obvious rigor was setting in.\n\n_Doomed. I'm doomed._\n\nThe pink loli didn't take kindly to being ignored. Jiaojiao felt a distinct danger to her hallucinatory life as that white hand descended for another slap. She hastily rolled away though she felt serious doubts about her current situation. Surely none of this mattered even if her head did became roadkill? That is-- If she truly was having a stroke. The bed groaned as another hole appeared by the first.\n\n\"The crown prince wouldn't even deign to let you lick his shoes! You're a toad lusting for swan meat!\" The girl sneered. \"You should just kill yourself and save me the trouble of dirtying my hands!\"\n\n\"The crown prince?\" Jiaojiao parroted, curled up in the corner of the bed, bracketed by wall and headboard and and covered in bamboo slivers.\n\n\"You still have the face to speak of the crown prince!?\"\n\nThird slap incoming, Jiaojiao had run out of rolling space. She hastily raised both hands in a gesture of surrender. \"Wait!\"\n\nThe girl paused and regarded Jiaojiao in disgust. Behind her, two servants in plain blue robes had entered at some point and were staring at Jiaojiao in shaudenfraude.\n\n\"I have no interest in the crown prince,\" Jiaojiao said. It was the truth, who was this crown prince even?\n\n\"Hah! As if I would believe your lies!\"\n\n\"Hold on!\" Jiaojiao called, interrupting that hand descending like a guillotine. \"I-- I've lost my memories!\"\n\n\"Hah?\" The girl glared, but the hand remained suspended.\n\n\"I... don't even know who you are?\" Jiaojiao supplied.\n\nThe girl scrutinized Jiaojiao from head to toe, as if there would be physical signs to elude to the veracity of that statement. She leaned forward, staring into Jiaojiao's face.\n\n\"Don't believe her, young miss,\" one of the servants interrupted.\n\n\"She's just lying to escape punishment,\" the other servant agreed.\n\nJiaojiao met the girl's gaze straight on. \"I really truly have lost my memories. I don't even know my own name.\"\n\n\"What a liar,\" the first servant laughed. \"Just slap her to death.\"\n\n\"Slap her to death!\"\n\n_What is wrong with these people?_\n\n\"Hmph,\" the girl finally smiled. \"So what if you don't remember? Now hold still so I can rid the world of an eyesore.\"\n\n\"You're seriously trying to kill her-- me?\" Jiaojiao asked with doubt.\n\n\"You finally understand,\" the girl smiled. Objectively, it was a nice smile on a pretty face, but it made the hairs stand up on the back of Jiaojiao's neck.\n\n\"Can we talk about this?\" Jiaojiao scrunched herself as far as she could go into the corner.\n\n\"What is there to talk about? You should have died back there in that pond. I'm just finishing the job.\"\n\nJiaojiao could only watch as that hand resumed its merciless descent, a harsh buzz began in her mind as the palm neared her unprotected face. The buzz reached an annoying crescendo then cut off with a wrathful pop.\n\nA bright box bloomed into view, floating in Jiaojiao's vision like a phantom.\n\nSimultaneously, the girl's descending slap suddenly veered off to the right and hit the wall with a crackle of broken plaster.\n\nThough her face had narrowly escaped getting pancaked by mere millimeters, Jiaojiao could only stare at the floating box in befuddlement. It was a translucent screen with a block of white text scrolling past and looked like something out of a VR simulation.\n\nThe girl hissed and shook out her blushing palm, smarting from the impact to the brick wall. \"You bitch, how dare you dodge!?\"\n\nThe servants darted forward, cooing in distress over their mistress's hand.\n\n\"You wretch! How could you hurt the miss's hand like this!\"\n\nJiaojiao was too distracted to answer, eyes riveted on the contents of that floating box that no one else seemed to see.\n\n*Bai Jing woke in a dirty old bedroom...**\n\n_Bai Jing smiled enchantingly as she caught Bai Xingwu's hand in an iron fist..._\n\n_Bai Jing kicked the girl away with her slim leg..._\n\n_Bai Jing slapped the impudent servant..._\n\n_Bai Jing..._\n\n\"Who the fuck is Bai Jing?\" Jiaojiao said.\n\nThe girl and the two servants stared agog at her outburst.\n\n\"Is there a Bai Jing in the family?\"\n\n\"I don't think so.\"\n\n\"What is she staring at?\"\n\n\"Maybe she's finally gone crazy.\"\n\n\"Heh! If I were her, I would've have gone crazy when I first heard I was a martial cripple.\"\n\n\"I would have just hung myself and ended it all.\"\n\n\"How could the crown prince have such a hideous toad for a fianc√©?\"\n\nThe servants tittered.\n\n\"Silence!\" The girl snapped, still rubbing her sore hand. \"Don't speak of the crown prince with your lowly mouths!\"\n\nThe servants bowed their heads. Though chastised, the corners of their lips turned up as they snuck glances at Jiaojiao and the girl in pink, no doubt anticipating the ensuing carnage.\n\nWhat bunch of manipulative she-devils.\n\nJiaojiao finally turned her gaze back to the bristling girl in pink, having finished digesting the contents of the floating box-- though not all of it made sense, she was beginning to get a hint of what was going on.\n\n\"Is your name Bai Xingwu?\"\n\nThe girl curled her lip up in ridicule. \"I thought you lost your memories?\"\n\n\"So it is,\" Jiaojiao pointed to the ghostly text box. \"None of you see that?\"\n\n\"See what? Don't think pretending to be crazy will get you out of anything!\"\n\n\"What do you want me to do?\" Jiaojiao asked, exasperated. \"Should I just lie down and let you kill me?\"\n\n\"It would be your honor to be killed by me!\"\n\nJiaojiao refrained from rolling her eyes. \"What can I do so that you won't kill me?\"\n\nBai Xingwu smiled, eyes crinkling in mirthful crescents. \"Kowtow. Kowtow until I tell you to stop.\"\n\n*And what if you never tell me to stop?* Jiaojiao rebutted internally. \"Fine,\" she said instead with a diplomatic smile and crawled off of the _kang_, avoiding the wreckage of the girl's punches. She paused as her right leg gave a twinge in pain.\n\n\"What are you waiting for?\" Bai Xingwu prodded, her smile mean and knowing.\n\nJiaojiao shuffled awkwardly to the dusty floor, then knelt, right knee now screaming in protest. There was definitely something up with that leg but she didn't currently have the time to address it. She took a distracted moment to admire Bai Xingwu's pearl-studded shoes, then lowered her head in the first kowtow, grimacing as the dirty floor neared her face. After a minute pause, her forehead touched the ground with an audible tap.\n\nThe harsh buzzing began anew. The girl gave her a pointed glare when Jiaojiao paused in thought.\n\n_It's all a stroke anyway! Why am I worrying?_\n\nOnly Jiaojiao knew herself fairly well, and she wasn't imaginative enough to dream this shit up by far.\n\nShe was feeling pain in a hallucination-- maybe not a hallucination. Every sight, smell, and feeling was indicating that she might _possibly, not really, actually_ be having a stroke.\n\nJiaojiao grit her teeth and began her second kowtow. Ignoring the buzzing in her head. A new box of text popped up next to the first, bobbing insistently. She gave it a cursory glance, then covertly rolled her eyes.\n\n_Bai Jing laughed as the servant wailed in pain..._\n\n_Bai Jing broke Bai Xingwu's hand with a snap of her wrist..._\n\n_\"How dare you call this great aunt a slut? Are you speaking of yourself?\"_\n\nOn her fifth kowtow, sweat began to head on her brow. Jiaojiao didn't enjoy pain and in fact usually went out of her way to avoid it-- like a normal person. This experience was swiftly becoming the most painful one she'd ever had the misfortune of encountering.\n\nJiaojiao touched her head to the dusty floor for the six time, the ground now damp with her sweat.\n\n\"Cry for me,\" Bai Xingwu suggested cooly. \"Ask for my forgiveness.\"\n\nWith a sniff, Jiaojiao began to wail and covered her face with her dusty hands, pressing down on her eyelids until her tear glands welled up with physiological tears. Blinking rapidly, she choked on her sobs as she coyly looked down.\n\n\"Hah! You're so ugly,\" the girl said, \"kowtow to me nine times and I'll let you go for today!\"\n\nThe ground beneath her face was now dotted with tears as well as saliva and sweat. Jiaojiao wailed theatrically, face coated in dust and grime.\n\n\"Look how ugly she is.\"\n\n\"Hideous.\"\n\n\"So disgusting.\"\n\nJiaojiao sobbed noisily, slurping a disgusting mixture of snot and tears with every inhale and exhale. The buzzing had now grown to deafening levels and Jiaojiao could hardly hear the servants deprecating commentary. Jiaojiao's entire focus had narrowed to the pain in her leg, and she had begun shaking from maintaining her posture. Only a certain premonition was preventing her from breaking this farce of a scene.\n\nThankfully, Bai Xingwu soon grew bored of the spectacle and takes before swinging her head, hairpins flashing with lustrous light.\n\n\"Let this be a lesson to you, slut! Don't you dare covet the crown prince! He is the heavens and you are less than dirt,\" the girl spat, then left with a swish of her sleeves, leaving behind only the scent of jasmine. Her two servants shot Jiaojiao one last ridiculing glance, then scurried after their mistress, kicking the ruins of the door aside on their way out.\n\nJiaojiao's cries cut off with an abruptness that struck of artificiality. She wiped her face with a tattered sleeve and regarded her departing audience with a lackluster expression.\n\nWhen the trio disappeared from view, so too did the buzzing cease.\n\nThe air grew heavy and solemn as Jiaojiao scanned her surroundings, hobbling back to the _kang_, now sporting two mango sized holes.\n\n\"All right, there's no one here,\" Jiaojiao said to the air. \"Come out.\"","lastmodified":"2022-04-29T11:35:13.400702706Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/Chapter02-The-Missing-Heroine":{"title":"Chapter 02-The Missing Heroine","content":"There was a heavy silence the moment Jiaojiao spoke to the empty room. Oppressive and somehow, sullen.\n\n*How did you know?* A voice asked sourly in her head. It was an ambiguous voice with a distinct lack of defining characteristics, neither male nor female and neither young or old.\n\n\"Did you think you were being subtle with the buzzing and humming?\" Jiaojiao scoffed, scanning the room for the disembodied voice. \"It was like having a silenced phone go off directly by my ear. Where are you anyway?\"\n\nA dim cloud of light, about the size of two fists popped into existence directly in front of Jiaojiao. She eyed it curiously. This was the the source of infernal buzzing?\n\n\"Who are you? What the hell is going on?\"\n\n*Who I am is none of your concern.*\n\n\"I'd say that's a sizzling hot take given that you're a hundred percent responsible for--\" she gestured at her current body.\n\nThe ball of light gave a disdainful buzz. *You're not required to know.*\n\n*Wow.* \"You got a name?\"\n\nThere came a prickling feeling from the cloud of light that Jiaojiao translated as irritation. *That's not important. What is important is that you were a disgrace just now. Why did you kowtow?*\n\n\"And what was the alternative? Let her squash me like a rice cake?\"\n\n*You could have fought back,* the ball of light grumbled. *You should-- what are you doing?!*\n\nJiaojiao tsked as her hand closed around nothing, the ball of light darting away from her grasping fingers. \n\n*How ill-mannered!* The ball scolded. *Keep your hands to yourself!*\n\n\"I'd say you've gone way beyond the boundaries of rudeness when you whisked my-- what? Soul? Into this place.\"\n\n*Can you be compared to me, puny mortal?*\n\n\"Puny mortal? Oh, it's like that is it?\" Jiaojiao smiled thinly. \"What does that make you, a god?\"\n\n*I may as well be a god!*\n\n\"Well, forgive me my impudence, oh *god*.\"\n\nA grudging hum. *You are forgiven, mortal. I myself made an error in judgement. I should not have put much expectation in your decorum in the first place given your... occupation.*\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n*You are after all--* a delicate pause *--an entertainer.*\n\n\"Entertain-- what?\"\n\n*And entertainers are not known for their refined behavior.*\n\nJiaojiao eyed the ball of light in thought. It seemed, the thing, god or whatever, had a superficial understanding of her, and an even worse understanding of the world she came from. And his sensibilities were downright ancient.\n\n\"What makes you think I'm an entertainer?\" she asked.\n\n*What else would you call what you do? You display yourself for the amusement of others. Is this not the definition of an entertainer? A lowly occupation with no meaningful worth to society?*\n\n\"Christ, who are you, my mother?\"\n\n*But we seem to have ventured onto a tangental thread of conversation. We were discussing--what are you doing now?!*\n\nJiaojiao ignored the ball and lifted the hem of her frayed robes and rolled up her pants to look at that damned right leg that had been troubling her. A knotted expanse of scar tissue and a crooked calf met her horrified gaze. She silently dropped the hem of her robe. *Not my body, not my problem.*\n\n*See this is exactly what I meant! No lady-like bearing at all! Baring your flesh for all the world to see!*\n\n\"The world isn't in here. Just you,\" Jiaojiao said. \"And besides, shouldn't it be you who is in the wrong for being in a young girl's boudoir?\"\n\n*As I was saying,* the ball's light pulsed with rage, *you have a lot to answer for, you disgraceful harlot.*\n\n\"No, don't hold back on my account. Tell me what you really think.\"\n\n*You bowed and scraped like a beggar. Have you seen yourself?*\n\n\"No actually,\" Jiaojiao answered. \"I can say with all honesty I have never seen myself.\"\n\n*Well, you are an absolute shame to behold! I am embarrassed on your behalf! Did you really have to kowtow?* the ball of light continued. *If you could have just--*\n\n\"Fought back?\" she pointed at her leg. \"You've seen the leg. This body is basically crippled.\"\n\n*Bai Jing did it, and she had the same leg. She fought Bai Xingwu and won. That's how it's supposed to go. Bai Xingwu and her two servants retreat in terror after losing to Bai Jing in a three on one fight.* The ball of light paused, and a heavy sense of oppression emanated from it. *At least, that's how it's supposed to go.*\n\nJiaojiao smiled a smile that wasn't a smile. \"Say, are you confused about something? What do those three have to do with me? Why should any of this have anything to do with me? You and I both know that I'm not this Bai Jing person.\"\n\nA heavy pause. The light flickered like a staticky TV.\n\n*Interesting.* The it finally said. *Most people would hesitate before admitting they weren't the person meant to be here. After all, you just died and it can be surmised that I'm the sole reason you still live and breathe...**\n\n\"Yes, yes, yes, you are very mighty, very powerful, I am very impress,\" Jiaojiao waved a hand. \"That doesn't change the fact that I am not Bai Jing and you can't expect me to behave like her.\"\n\n*You don't have a choice. You have already died. The person you were no longer exists. If you cannot be Bai Jing then there is no use for you at all.*\n\nJiaojiao wrinkled her nose then took a sniff of her shoulder, having been nagged by the faint smell of mildew ever since waking. She got a whiff of stagnant water and algae. A tell-tale patch of green on her sleeve drew her attention. Well, that angry little girl had said something about a near drowning. A completed drowning? After all, *she* was here.\n\n*It should be obvious that I hold your very life and death in my hands...*\n\nJiaojiao sidestepped the ball and hobbled over to the battered armoire taking a hold of the ornated bronze handles, green with oxidation. When a firm tug left the doors unbudging, she leveraged all eighty-five pounds of her new body to wrench it open. Her arms ached with the strain and the nerves in her bum leg screamed in protest. The doors stuck on each other, swollen with age and moisture. A glance overhead revealed a patch of missing roof tiles, repaired haphazardly with a few handfuls of thatch and straw twine.\n\nInside the armoire was a collection of worn and aged clothing, moth-eaten silk and frayed cotton in various washed out colors. Jiaojiao paused. Did she really have to don these... these *rags*?\n\n*If you want to continue living, you will do well to follow my instructions... are you listening to me?*\n\n\"Yes, I am very invested in this conversation. Do continue.\"\n\n*You are dead.*\n\n\"Uh huh.\"\n\n*... shouldn't you be more upset?*\n\n \"What?\" Jiaojiao rifled through the meager selection of *hanfu*. \"Should I be weeping and wailing? Groveling at your feet for absolution?\"\n\n*It would be the expected reaction.*\n\n\"I'm already dead, what's to be done?'\" Jiaojiao said. \"I won't waste my time begging you for something you won't change. After all, if you were truly kind, you would have revived me in my own body instead of casting me as this Bai Jing person.\"\n\nA hum of grudging agreement came from the ball. *I brought you here for a purpose.*\n\nJIaojiao chose one of the least ratty robes and pulled it from the armoire. \"Avert your virgin eyes, o' god, for this filthy mortal entertainer is about to disrobe.\"\n\nThe ball gave a disgusted snarl and zipped to hide behind the armoire door. *Have you heard a single word I've said? Must you do that now?*\n\n\"Dead mortal, alive on your grace, here for a mission. I'm all ears. And yes, I'm reeking of pond scum, and I simply cannot stand it a second longer.\"\n\n*...as I was saying, your only purpose here is to take the place of Bai Jing.*\n\n\"What happened to her anyway?\" Jiaojiao asked as she shucked the damp robe from her body. It was of noticeably finer make and she would have preferred wearing it to the beggars garment she was shortly about to don were it not foul with pond water.\n\nThe ball of light paused, as if loathe to disclose an iota more information than absolutely necessary. *She failed the appear at the correct time. We were forced to take drastic measures to ensure the continuity of this fateline.*\n\nJiaojiao's eyes flashed as she bowed her head to tie the belt on her clean robe. *Fate-line? Does that have something to do with that box of text I just saw?* \"So I have her to thank for this second life?\"\n\n*You have __me__ to thank for this second life.*\n\n\"Sure boss, whatever you say.\"\n\n*I'm glad you understand your position. Just do as you're told and all will be well.*\n\n\"What happens if I don't do as I'm told?\"\n\nThe ball of light floated in front of Jiaojiao. A palpable oppression prickled at her skin as the light burst in intensity, bright stripes strobed across its surface. *Then I'll get rid of you and find a more obedient replacement.* \n\nJiaojiao shivered, then smiled thinly. \"Got it.\"\n\nThe ball seemed satisfied with her response, withdrawing out of arms reach and the light dimmed to less blinding levels.\n\n\"So what do I have to do?\"\n\nThe light began to strobe again. *Hold still, this will only hurt a bit.*\n\nThe world exploded into light.\n\nJiaojiao eyes stung as the light hit her eyes, she lifted an arm to shield herself, but it didn't seem to make a difference. The it was like the light was piercing straight past her flesh and directly impacting her brain tissue. The beginnings of a migraine began to make itself known as dense blocks of text scrolled past her vision at an accelerated pace. Even as Jiaojiao thought that this was far too fast for anyone to read, the information seared itself into her mind as though it was being directly funneled into her synapses.\n\n*Bai Jing stood at the cliffside with her lover Fei Chen. The distant sunset gave a romantic backdrop to their rendevous.*\n\n*\"Fel Chen, it has been almost ten years since we made that promise.\"\n\n*\"I remember...\"*\n\n*\"We can leave everything behind now...\"*\n\n*Fei Chen embraced Bai Jing, smiling down at his beautiful fiance. Bai Jing smiled and turned her face upwards to receive his fiery kiss...*\n\n*Bai Jing gasped, the pulled back at a sudden sharp pain on her chest. Right over her heart pierced a dagger. A brilliant blood-red flower bloomed...*\n\n*\"Why?\" she asked the sinisterly smiling Fei Chen.*\n\n\"I've never loved you, Bai Jing? Who would love a coarse mercenary like you? My true love is your half-sister! I was only after the inheritance your mother left you!\" \n\n*Fei Chen snatched the embroidered pouch from Bai Jing's chilled fingers.*\n\n*\"Fei Chen, you better pray I don't live, or I'll make you sorry...\"*\n\n*Bai Jing plunged from the cliff...*\n\nJiaojiao could only stand, transfixed as more text scrolled past her vision. She screwed her eyes shut, but nothing could stop the information pouring into her mind. Dear lord this is torture.\n\n*Bai Jing awoke in an ancient bedroom...*\n\n*Bai Jing spoke to the reflection in the bronze mirror. \"Fate has given me a second chance, I won't let your sacrifice go to waste. I will avenge all your grievamces and punish all those who drove you to your death!\"\"*\n\n*Bai Jing kicked Bai Xingwu across the room...*\n\n*Bai Jing smiled...*\n\n*Bai Jing laughed...*\n\n*Bai Jing sneered...*\n\nJiaojiao felt like she was going crazy. On and on it went until finally the text slowed to a crawl before disappearing with a faint pop. She opened her eyes and gave the ball of light a dirty look.\n\n*Well?* The ball of light said impatiently, *Did you get all of it?*\n\nJiaojiao gave a mirthless chuckle. \"Oh I got it. There's just one little problem.\"\n\n*What is it?*\n\n\"Are you kidding? You made it sound like some grand mission but I can't do this,\" JIaojiao shook her head. \"Nope. I can't help you.\" \n\n*I don't follow.*\n\n\"You don't need a heroine! You need an editor! Nothing less will save us from this crappy webnovel!\"","lastmodified":"2022-04-29T11:35:13.400702706Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/Chapter03-The-Cold-Prince-Loves-Me-Dearly":{"title":"Chapter 03-The Cold Prince Loves Me Dearly","content":"\"The Cold Prince Loves me Dearly?\" Jiaojiao could barely get the words out through her upset. \"You brought me here for this?\"\n\n*I fail to see what the problem is.*\n\n\"Fail to see the problem-- of course you would. You're not he one being forced to play out over five hundred chapters of nonsense!\"\n\n*Actually, it's over five thousand, but I didn't want to overload your puny mortal brain with too much information at once.*\n\n*Lord, guanyin, yama, whoever, save me from this farce.* Jiaojiao slumped over the *kang.* A webnovel! Not only was this a webnovel, it was a badly written one too, with plot holes, repetitive plot lines and more tired tropes than she could care to name. Not only that, it was of the xianxia genre, heavily featuring a romance she found highly problematic. Not only that! There were *xian* and *gui* and whole bunch of other things she wasn't equipped to deal with. \n\nThere was cultivation. That explained that angry girl's inhuman strength, and apparently her display of prowess was only the tip of the iceberg.\n\n\"Piz-dets,\" Jiaojiao muttered.\n\n*What was that?*\n\n\"Say, you seem to have overlooked something very important, Guang Qiu.\"\n\n*Guang Qiu?* The ball of light vibrated in agitation. *You are addressing me?*\n\n\"You are a ball of light and you refuse to disclose your name to the likes of I, so yes, Guang Qiu.\"\n\n*The nerve! I am far more than some ball of light!*\n\n\"Anyway, Guang Qiu,\" Jiaojiao continued. \"You seemed to have forgotten that an *entertainer* and an assassin have very different skill sets.\"\n\nThat's right. Bai Jing, the missing heroine, was an assassin. Not only was she an assassin, she was the supposedly the best of her kind, feared in the underworld of her original world as the embodiment of death. Her victims numerous enough to \"circle the globe once.\" Jiaojiao was too lazy to inspect the math on that claim.\n\n Trained in the art of killing from the tender age of seven, she could kill you with a knife, she could kill you a spoon, hell, she could probably kill with both her hands *and legs* tied behind her back. And not only was she good at killing people, she was trained in both western and eastern medicine. \n\nShe could kill with a needle, and she could similarly save lives with one too. At least, if the contents of the webnovel were to be believed.  \n\nA merciless reaper with a heart of gold. Beautiful, treacherous, and cold. Cold at least, when it came to people other than her paramour, Fei Chen.\n\nThe same Fei Chen who apparently stabbed her in the heart and forced her off a cliff for some mystical inheritance.\n\nYikes.\n\nAnyway, the recently murdered Bai Jing, understandably wrathful, had somehow revived in the body of also recently murdered Bai Xingyue, the same drowned body that Jiaojiao was currently wearing. And here was where the road split.\n\nBai Jing the assassin kicked Bai Xingwu and her two servants into next year,  laughing at their attempts to bully her. Then, she forced them to kowtow, beating their foreheads bruised and bloodied before sending them scurrying back whence they came, cradling broken wrists and broken egos.\n\nJiaojiao the influencer showed as much spine as a sea anenome and debased herself like the filthy mortal entertainer she was. \n\n*No, matter,* the ball of light said smoothly, *with me here, all your inadequacies will be immaterial.*\n\nJiaojiao gave a ball a thousand-yard stare and shuffled toward the bedroom exit, squeezing past the door barely hanging on by one hinge.\n\n*Where are you going?*\n\n\"This mortal has some mortal things to do.\"\n\n*What things can possible be more important than the mission?*\n\n\"Bathroom!\"\n\n*Bathroom?*\n\n\"It's called a bladder you disembodied simpleton.\"\n\nShe left the sputtering Guang Qiu to get upset over her directness, hobbling past a dusty room, equally sad as the one she'd just left, with old worn furniture and cobwebs. Jiaojiao quickly located the front door to the building, it wasn't hard, the mean trio hadn't bothered closing the doors after themselves. The pain in her leg was a persistent presence as she leaned against the cracked doorframe and peered outside. \n\nIn the midday light, a neglected courtyard came into view, weeds peeking out from between the flagstones. A half withered apricot tree twisted overhead, casting curled shadows on the walkway. Dead leaves filled the corners of the patchy walls, spotty with flaking limestone plaster and creeping moss. There was even a sizable hole in the wall directly across from her, large enough to stick her head through.  A second and third building, smaller than the main house stood off to the side, in an equal state of disrepair and entropy. A small pond with a wealth of duckweed and choked with clumps of algae completed the depressing scene.\n\nJiaojiao ignored all this in favor of the shabby outhouse in the far corner of the courtyard, also missing roof shingles and with a door that hung crookedly in its frame. \n\n*It'll be fine!* Jiaojiao pep-talked herself, *it will be like camping. We did that once, right?* \n\nIt had been an expensive company retreat with running water, yoga instructors, and h'orderves but *let's not think about that right this second.*\n\nGritting her teeth against the stabbing pain in her right-calf, she shuffled over. It was only about twenty meters but it felt like twenty miles.\n\nAt ten meters, Jiaojiao was already wrinkling her nose at the smell. Delightful. Her face grew ever more pinched with dread as she neared the source of the distinctive aroma. \n\n*It's fine. I'm fine. Everything's--*\n\nShe wrenched open the door and gagged on the stench.¬†\n\nAfter hesitating on the threshold for a good thirty seconds, silently choking on the smell, she finally gathered the remnants of her waning courage and hopped inside, shutting the door behind her. After a nerve-wracking ten seconds, fumbling with the unwieldy folds of her robes, she finished her business, then realized there was no toilet paper. She nearly died of shock on the spot.\n\nFinally, she ripped off a corner of her robes to finally put an end to the horrible affair and dashed outside as quickly as her gimp leg allowed.\n\n\"That's it,\" Jiaojiao announced, incoherent with disgust. \"I can't. Just no.\"\n\nShe drifted back inside the house, muttering to herself. \"Isn't it just dying? I can just do it again.\"\n\n*What are you talking about?* the ball of light floated over, emanating superiority.\n\nJiaojiao looked at it with the gaze of a man recently returned from the front-lines. \n\nBefore Jiaojiao could tear into the ball for sending her to this godforsaken era, a noise came from outside.\n\n\"Aiya! What happened here?\" A high voice cried. \"Young miss! Are you all right? Young miss!\"\n\nRapid footsteps, then a portly old woman dressed in gray robes came into view. Her face was plump with the beginnings of age-spots on her cheeks. Her wrinkled forehead creased with worry as she looked Jiaojiao up and down. \"Yueyue! Did that awful second young miss come by again? You're not hurt are you?\"\n\nThe old woman dropped her basket of vegetables, making tsking noises as she came up to take Jiaojiao's sleeves. \"Why are you wearing your good robe? Why is it ripped? Did the second miss do this?\" \n\n*These are the good robes?*\n\nJiaojiao tried to draw back, alarmed as the old woman took a hank of limp hair and folded it behind Jiaojiao's ear, but the old woman's grip was like iron. She was further dumbfounded when the woman *picked her up* by the elbows and deposited her onto the ruined *kang* not even batting an eye at the two mango-sized holes in the middle of the bed.\n\n\"Don't you worry, Yueyue, I harvested some good bamboo just the other day, you won't have to sleep on the floor tonight.\"\n\n*Sleep on the floor?* Jiaojiao echoed shrilly in her head. *You better fucking believe that's never happening.*\n\nJiaojiao spent the next twenty minutes watching the old woman bustle about, having been deposited onto three-legged stool like a doll. The old woman pulled out an old stone bucket from somewhere and placing it in the middle of the courtyard. She proceeded to light some coals on fire, turning her head away when it spat out plumes of foul smoke.\n\n\"I spent this month's stipend on some charcoal,\" the old woman told her cheerfully. \"You won't have to wear your padded jacket to sleep tonight.\"\n\nJiaojiao had no response to this delightful news.\n\nAs the old woman took out a dented copper pot and and cup of broken rice, Jiaojiao finally identified the old woman from the wealth of text swimming in her head. \n\n\"Cen Wei.\"\n\nThe old woman peered over curiously. \"What is it Yueyue? Are you feeling ill?\"\n\nJiaojiao forced out a smile. \"It's nothing.\"\n\n\"Yueyue! You're smiling!\" The old lady threw down a handful of wilted vegetables and scurried over, frowning in worry. \"You're smiling! Are you sure you're alright?\"\n\n*Damn, how miserable was this Yueyue that a smile would read as a red flag?*\n\nThe old woman fussed over Jiaojiao, turning her this way and that with her inhuman strength. Jiaojiao could only sit there and take it with her stick limbs and bum leg. She shot a pointed look at the ball of light floating off to the side, but it showed no reaction to her distress, seemingly content to watch her be manhandled. Jiaojiao was fast growing tired of being treated like a living doll by this old woman.\n\nAfter the mixture of broken rice and handful of cabbage leaf coagulated into a depressing looking gruel, the woman banked the charcoal fire and ushered Jiaojiao back into the main room. She plopped her onto a flat cushion that has seen better days, jolting a wince out of her as her leg brushed the floor at a bad angle.\n\nWhat followed was the worst meal Jiaojiao had ever had the displeasure of tasting. She hadn't had much expectation seeing the ingredients that had gone into the copper pot, but...\n\n\"Are these worm holes?\" Jiaojiao asked, a tremor in her voice, holding aloft a boiled cabbage leaf with mismatched chopsticks.\n\n\"They were only two bits of copper at market, I got two whole baskets!\" Cen Wei said, yellowed teeth on display with a wide smile. \"We can have vegetables all every meal this week!\"\n\nJiaojiao took one look at that expectant face, seemingly searching for praise, and laughed a little hysterically. \"I'm full,\" she said finally, placing down her bowl on the uneven tea table, the surface pockmarked from years of abuse and missing half its mother-of-pearl inlays.\n\n\"How can you be full?\" Cen Wei asked in disapproval. \"You barely ate.\"\n\n\"Why don't you eat instead?\" Jiaojiao suggested.\n\nThis was apparently the wrong thing to say as Cen Wei's expression fell.\n\n\"Have I done something wrong, miss?\" Cen Wei asked in a wobbly voice, her creased hand coming up to wipe the tears collecting in her eyes. \"I know it's not much, but I tried my best to come up with this meal.\"\n\n\"I'm just not hungry,\" Jiaojiao deflected. \"You did nothing wrong.\"\n\n\"Those bastard kitchen hands cut off our daily meals again! They are too much! I almost thought I would have to beg in the streets so we wouldn't starve!\" Cen Wei slammed a fist on the table. The legs groaned in protest and another inlay popped off the surface, but she paid it no mind, too caught up in her diatribe. \n\n\"Or are you not feeling well because...\" she gave Jiaojiao a commiserating look. \"I didn't want to speak of it, because I know you must feel ashamed, but is this because of what happened yesterday?\" Cen Wei asked with sniff. \"My poor Yueyue! Humiliated in front of half the capital!\"\n\n\"It's not--\"\n\n\"It's that awful first miss!\" Cen Wei said with a wail. \"She set you up! She knew you didn't want to go to the palace feast, but she forced you into the carriage anyway! I know how shy you are about your birthmark! How could you possibly have gone to that feast of your own will!\"\n\nJiaojiao sat back and watched the old woman degenerate into a fretful mess of tears and indignation on behalf of the absent Yueyue. \n\n*So noisy,* Guang Qiu finally spoke.\n\n\"So fake,\" Jiaojiao said.\n\n\"What was that, Yueyue?\" Cen Wei said, looking at her sharply.\n\n\"Nothing, nothing,\" Jiaojiao said with a thin smile. \"I was just saying how I don't feel like eating because of what happened yesterday.\"\n\nCen Wei stared at Jiaojiao for a long time, expression clouded. \"Yes, Yueyue must still be in shock, after all you almost died in that pond.\"\n\nJiaojiao forced herself to eat the thin gruel, nibbling on a few mouthfuls of bitter cabbage leaves before the appalling meal finally drew to a close. Cen Wei didn't urge her to eat more, taking away the half-full bowl. \n\nShe murmured some excuse about being tired, then excused herself to her room, maneuvering the broken door back into its frame with a grunt of effort.\n\n\"Guang Qiu,\" Jiaojiao said, when she was sure Cen Wei wasn't listening in.\n\n*What?* the ball asked, having retired to the inner chambers with her.\n\n\"Don't tell me you didn't notice?\" Jiaojiao asked incredulously.\n\n*Notice what?*\n\n\"Are you blind? There's something wrong with Cen Wei.\"","lastmodified":"2022-04-29T11:35:13.400702706Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/Chapter04-Cen-Wei-the-Suspicious":{"title":"Chapter 01-Cen Wei the Suspicious","content":"*What are you doing?*\n\nJiaojiao ignored the ball of light in favor of peeking through one of the many holes in the front window. The old woman, Cen Wei, was cheerfully puttering about in the courtyard. Jiaojiao watched with morbid curiosity as the woman went into one of the other buildings and came out with a wooden bucket, a shovel and a length of cloth tied around her face. The woman disappeared into the horrific outhouse Jiaojiao was still suffering ongoing flashbacks about with her implements.\n\n\"What is *she* doing?\" Jiaojiao asked. \n\n*You are behaving oddly. I see nothing wrong with the old woman?*\n\nJiaojiao didn't reply, busy going over what she knew of Cen Wei from the godawful text in her mind. Cen Wei didn't have much of a presence in The Cold Prince Loves Me Dearly. The sum of her parts was less than five thousand words, a pitiful count in comparison to characters such as Bai Xingwu who had upwards of sixty thousand words describing her interactions with Bai Jing.\n\nCen Wei was the wet-nurse of Bai Xingyue's mother-- well, her supposed mother, Mu Haoru-- lets not get into that mess right now. But she was a devoted servant from the past generation and had taken care of Bai Xingyue all her life. Despite this, she didn't show doubt at Bai Xingyue's sudden change in personality when Bai Jing took over. Instead, citing her change as her young miss having \"finally grown up.\" She was a sycophantic presence next to the transmigrated Bai Jing, never saying a word against this new version of her young miss. Even curiouser, she never once doubted Bai Jing's strength, despite Bai Xingyue being a lifelong cripple with no martial training. From beginning to end, Cen Wei was described as a loyal if somewhat dull-witted servant.\n\nCurious.\n\nCen Wei came out of the outhouse five minutes later, bucket full of... Jiaojiao surpressed her churning stomach. \"You seriously don't see it? This old woman is *suss*.\"\n\n*What?*\n\n\"She's a servant. If she truly cared for her master then why was this body still wearing the wet clothes after nearly drowning? Isn't it common sense that a person should change clothes after getting them wet? Yet this poor girl lay in soggy clothes all night. There's something wrong with your book.\"\n\n*So the servant is lazy, it doesn't mean the book is wrong.*\n\nAnother thin smile. \"Sure hon. But I haven't even gotten to this old woman's real odd points. I mean, just look at her.\"\n\nThe was a pause as the ball took an irritated glance at the old woman, now swishing the defiled shovel in the courtyard pond. *I see nothing odd about her.*\n\n\"Look at her, and look at this body,\" Jiaojiao held up a feeble wrist. \"What loyal servant is that plump while her master starves? I call bullshit.\"\n\n*...perhaps it's simply a difference of physique?*\n\nJiaojiao was beginning to think that Guang Qiu wasn't very bright despite his luminous appearance. \"Yeah? And what about these hands? Just look at these nails!\"\n\nA chipped nail was thrust in front of Guang Qiu like a piece of case-breaking evidence.\n\n*...what about them?*\n\n\"Um, hello? She's supposed to be the master? Why do her hands look worse than the old lady's? You don't get hands like these unless you're doing hard labor, like handwashing clothes in the dead of winter or something.\"\n\nThere was a considering air emanating from the ball. *Perhaps you have a point.*\n\nJiaojiao smiled--\n\n*But that still doesn't mean the book was wrong. There's nothing here that says that the old woman wasn't simply avoiding her duties. It doesn't mean she is disloyal at heart.* The ball insisted, though it didn't seem quite as certain as before.\n\nJiaojiao rolled her eyes. \"I haven't even mentioned the most damning piece of evidence. This one is even backed up by your precious book.\"\n\n*What evidence?*\n\n\"Bai Xingyue's poison,\" Jiaojiao said with a smirk. \"This girl is being poisoned right? Where do you think it's coming from?\"\n\n*I don't follow.*\n\n\"Do I have to spell it out for you? Are you an idiot? Do you even have two brain cells to rub together?\"\n\n*You dare insult my intelligence--*\n\n\"Cen Wei herself said the kitchens are withholding rations. Where is the poison coming from?\" Jiaojiao spoke as if to a very slow child.\n\nThere was a long, excruciating pause.\n\n*The poison comes from Head Wife Zhang. It says so in the book.*\n\n\"Yeah, but how is it getting to Bai Xingyue, you dumb brick?\"\n\nAnother sullen pause. *Very well, perhaps your suspicions are not totally groundless.*\n\n\"Good lord, he can be taught. Speaking of poison,\" Jiaojiao said. \"How exactly do you plan on ridding me of it? It'll be hilarious if after all this talk the body simply keels over. Keels over again, I mean.\"\n\n*Because you are an entertainer with no training in the medical arts, I will have to find an alternative way to cure you of the poison currently plaguing you.* \n\n\"Sure, whatever.\"\n\nAs they spoke, Cen Wei had disappeared from view with her bucket of... leavings. Perhaps this would lead to a marginal improvement in smell, though Jiaojiao wasn't getting her hopes up. She wasn't too curious about where those leavings were going to end up. Nope.\n\n\"Anyway, Guang Qiu--\" Jiaojiao ignored the ball as it bristled at its moniker \"--if I learn to cultivate, does that I no longer have to use the bathroom?\"\n\n*What does that have to do with anything?*\n\n\"I don't expect you to understand, since you are but a disembodied orb, but this matter has a direct relation to my sanity, so please answer the question.\"\n\n*...once you reach Jindan stage, you will be able to exist solely on spirit energy, thus negating the need to defecate.*\n\n\"Sweet. I'll keep that in mind.\"\n\n*Perhaps we should now speak of your next move. Given that you're not capable of curing yourself, you'll need to find a doctor. You must fix your leg as soon as possible if you are to keep up with the timeline in the book.*\n\n\"Ugh, do we have to talk about this now?\" Jiaojiao protested. \"I need a bath and a *real* change of clothes, where can I find those? And I haven't even seen what I look like yet! Am I ugly? This body is pretty ugly, right?\"\n\nThe ball seemed out of patience as it began to emanate an unseen pressure.\n\n\"Don't emote me! Like you can understand when you don't even have a body. Why don't we switch places and I can be the judgmental presence hovering over you instead?\"\n\n*Don't waste your time wishing for the impossible, mortal!*\n\n\"Whatever, I--\" Jiaojiao paused. \"Did you see that?\"\n\n*What is it now?*\n\nJiaojiao stared intently at the hole in the courtyard wall. She could have sworn she saw a face peeking into the yard. Before she could speak again, Cen Wei barged into the room, lugging a large wooden tub. Jiaojiao's eyes lit up.\n\n\"Nevermind, it's nothing.\"\n\nWhat followed was a highly uncomfortable bath with lukewarm water, supervised by an overzealous servant that insisted on scrubbing her from head to toe with a sponge that felt more like a pumice stone. Jiaojiao tried several times to shoo Cen Wei away, unable to forget that those same hands scrubbing her body were engaged in far fouler chores less than an hour ago, and she had yet to see Cen Wei break out an antibacterial soap, but the old servant was not to be deterred. \n\nShe was far less concerned about her own nakedness. Jiaojiao didn't feel modesty, she after all, was not in her own body, and even if she were, she had long had modesty drummed out of her by her profession as an \"entertainer.\" Jiaojiao finally got a closer look at her new body, and she did not like it one bit. \n\nBai Xingyue was distressingly skinny, akin to pictures of starving refuges Jiaojiao had seen on the news or in documentaries. There were strange red striations around her joints. Curious, she'd pushed on them and felt a spreading numbness. She wanted answers, but Guang Qiu had long excused themselves and Jiaojiao couldn't very well ask Cen Wei the Poisoner, as she caught the servant looking at her with questioning eyes.\n\n\"Is something wrong, Yueyue?\"\n\n\"Nothing, just cold,\" Jiaojiao said, ducking her head to hide a repulsed shiver.\n\nCen Wei spread a few crumbs of inferior quality *zao dou*, or \"bath beans\" that gave off a weak lather. Jiaojiao was very interested in the ancient soap, given that she was a sucker for vegan beauty products, but seeing Cen Wei's strange look as she handled the soap sent her inner curiosity deflating. \n\nAfter the awkward affair, Cen Wei left to dispose of the bathwater while Jiaojiao changed into clothes she reluctantly deemed tolerable, if not acceptable. Homeless chic was *never* a good look in her mind, but what could you do when you were the disgraced and bullied second miss of a cold, impersonal clan?\n\nGuang Qiu reappeared the moment Jiaojiao was dressed, sending her impatient vibes. *You mortals are so troublesome.*\n\n\"Yes, yes, spare me the lecture about mortal filth,\" Jiaojiao said.\n\n\"Who are you talking to, Yueyue?\" Cen Wei asked with a concerned frown, craning her head around the broken door. \n\n\"Nobody, just talking myself.\"\n\n*You don't have to speak aloud,* Guang Qiu said with condescension. *I can hear your thoughts.*\n\n\"No you can't,\" Jiaojiao said. \"If you could, you'd be far angrier with me.\"\n\n*I can hear thoughts you direct at me.* \n\n*Can you hear this, sad rave?* Jiaojiao thought cautiously, not attempting to \"send\" thoughts.\n\n*Brainless nightlight,* she thought with slightly more intent.\n\n*Discount disco,* she tried again when Guang Qui showed no reaction.\n\n*What,* if Guang Qiu had teeth, Jiaojiao didn't doubt she would have heard them grinding that very moment. *Is a disco.*\n\nJiaojiao's reply was interrupted as Cen Wei returned with a comb with missing teeth and a battered bronze mirror. \"Yueyue, come here, let me dry your hair.\"\n\nJiaojiao dutifully sat on the ground by the low table and Cen Wei placed the dented mirror in front of her. It looked much like something that should be on exhibit at a museum, complete with an ages worth of scratches and shedding teal flakes of oxidation. The servant had a strange glint in her eye and Jiaojiao didn't have long to wonder why as she got a look at the face in the mirror.\n\nBai Jing in the webnovel had been described as a world-stopping beauty, both before her death and as her reincarnation in Bai Xingyue's body. The face in the mirror however, lacked any sort of grace or enviable qualities so extoled by the author. There was no smooth skin, or brilliant eyes shining with determination or haughtiness inherent to those confident in their own worth. There was no lustrous black hair or red ruby lips. No oval-shaped face, or long, curled lashes, like that of a butterfly's wing.\n\nThere reflected in the bronze was a small, weak girl, a large, muddy-red stain marred the left half of her face, covering most of her forehead, cutting down across the middle of her face, lashing her nosebridge and over her left eye. Most of her left cheek was similarly discolored and the stain went on to cover most of her ear and extend into her hairline. The mark was a deep maroon, mottled, and had strange squiggly marks like veins.\n\nJiaojiao raised a hand and placed in on the mark, deep in thought. Cen Wei spoke by her ear. \"Don't be sad, miss, you are still very beautiful in my heart.\"\n\n*If you knew she would be sad, why put the mirror in front of her, you sadistic old biddy.* If Jiaojiao still had doubts about Cen Wei's attitude about her charge, they were thoroughly dispelled in this second. She actually sounded happy at the thought that the young girl would be distressed by her own ugliness.\n\nUnfortunately, Jiaojiao was here, and Jiaojiao, though self-confessed to be incurably vain, wasn't stupid enough to confuse her own face with the face of the stranger in the mirror. And more importantly, wasn't Bai Jing able to dispel this mark from her face with relative ease? It hadn't even taken her five chapters in fact.\n\nBut what did Guang Qiu think of all this? Jiaojiao shot it a meaningful glance, but it hovered there, unaffected by the scene of an old woman tormenting a young girl with her own inadequacies. Whatever, she evidently expected too much from that idiot. \n\n*Oy, what do you think of the old woman?* Jiaojiao prodded.\n\n*What is there to say? Isn't she being kind by combing your hair? She is simply doing her job as your servant.*\n\nRiiiight. *Sure hon. Whatever you say.*\n\nCen Wei carefully, lovingly even, combed through the tangles of Jiaojiao's thin locks. Given malnutrition and lack of modern hair products, or any hair products really, the girl's hair wasn't in great condition. Jiaojiao grabbed a handful of split ends and grimaced. Nothing short of a haircut could save this mess, unfortunately, if the ancient standards of the world were consistent, then it would be considered an unfilial crime to cut ones hair. \n\nNot that something like that was going to stop Jiaojiao from doing *what needed to be done.*\n\nJiaojiao took another look at the face in the mirror. Cen Wei had started humming behind her, a cheerful tune that grated on her nerves and she did her best to ignore her. The face had potential, Jiaojiao admitted. The book author wasn't completely talking out of her ass when she described Bai Jing as a beauty to end all beauties. The bone structure was good, with delicate, high cheekbones, and underneath the mark, the skin was even in spite of the illusion given by the squiggling, veinlike marks. \n\nYes, she could work with this. Given her occupation, she would be embarrassed if she couldn't work with such material. Even if the little girl *had* been plain, it wouldn't have made a differences A good diet, some exercise-- after that damned leg was fixed-- and some make-up magic, what heart-stopping beauty couldn't she make?\n\nBesides, the mark wasn't natural to begin with, not a birthmark as said in rumors, but a poison, courtesy of Head Wife Zhang. Some more inter-house drama she wasn't looking forward to navigating but...\n\n*What are you going to do about the poison?* Jiaojiao asked Guang Qiu in her head, prodding the mark. *Bai Jing had that magical inheritance to help her, but I don't have that, do I?*\n\nGuang Qiu paused, having realized he had overlooked yet another, very important detail.\n\n*That's... Guang Qiu stalled, apparently at a loss.\n\nShe shook her head, wincing as Cen Wei's comb caught on a difficult knot.\n\n*I'll think of something.* \n\nJiaojiao almost felt sorry for the dumb thing. It was clearly baling water out of a sinking ship.","lastmodified":"2022-04-29T11:35:13.400702706Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/Chapter05-Bai-Jings-Artifact":{"title":"Chapter 05-Bai Jing's Artifact","content":"Cen Wei soon finished combing Jiaojiao's hair and retreated with the dented mirror, smile a touch smugger than before. Jiaojiao didn't care to speculate on the old woman's inner thoughts, as poisonous as they must be.\n\nGuang Qiu went back to its silence, content to float there, unassuming, at least, until Cen Wei came back, arms laden with bamboo strips.\n\n\"What's this?\" Cen Wei suddenly said with surprise.\n\nJiaojiao looked over to see the old woman holding a delicately carved bangle in her thick palm. It was made of a shimmery pear wood and seemed far too small to fit on her stout wrist.\n\n*That's--!*\n\nCen Wei turned the bracelet this way and that, giving Jiaojiao an inquisitive look. \"Where did this come from?\"\n\n*If my suspicions are correct...* thought Jiaojiao.\n\n*Grab it!* Guang Qiu suddenly screamed in her mind, loud enough to cause Jiaojiao to jolt in alarm.\n\n\"That's mine,\" Jiaojiao said instead with a careful expression. \"Can I have it back, please?\"\n\nCen Wei gave her a considering stare, hands rubbing the exquisite bracelet between her hands. \"This looks expensive.\"\n\n\"It's really not,\" Jiaojiao said. \"It's fake. I got it for a few coppers.\"\n\nThe furrow between the servant's brows deepened. \"When did you buy it? You never leave the estate.\"\n\n*Woops.* \"I asked another servant to buy it for me.\"\n\nCen Wei didn't look like she believed her. \"Where did you get the money? Who did you ask?\"\n\n*This servant really dared.* \"Does it matter where I got the money? Now give it to me.\" Jiaojiao held out her hand, palm up.\n\n\"Yueyue!\" Cen Wei looked scandalized. \"How can a young lady speak like that?\"\n\nThe bracelet disappeared  into her sleeve. \"Don't worry, I will keep this safe for you. You know how forgetful you are! Wouldn't want you to lose such a pretty thing! You know how things sometimes disappear around you.\"\n\n*Aided largely in part by a certain servant, I would imagine.* Jiaojiao thought sardonically.\n\n*What are you sitting there for?!* Guang Qiu screamed. *Just take it from her, she's but an old woman!*\n\nJiaojiao stood.\n\n*Wait!* \n\nJiaojiao smirked and sat back down.\n\n*You can't get into a conflict with her,* Guang Qiu said, sounding annoyed. *It would derail the plot too much.*\n\n\"I must say, you are behaving very oddly!\" Cen Wei scolded. \"I know you must not be very happy after humiliating yourself, but this is no reason to misbehave!\"\n\n*You will have to take it from her unnoticed,* Guang Qiu said wearily. *You cannot allow your relationship with her to sour.*\n\n*The woman is already poisoning me,* Jiaojiao laughed inwardly. *Could the relationship be worse?*\n\nCen Wei had gone back to stripping the broken bamboo slats from the kang, apparently not feeling even a moment of shame for brazenly stealing from her mistress.\n\n*This impudent servant!* Guang Qiu roared, floating around the old woman and swirling in agitation.\n\nIn shortly less than an hour, Cen Wei had patched the bed, deft fingers flying over the frame, evidently used to performing such repairs. Jiaojiao had to wonder how often Bai Xingwu had ruined Bai Xingyue's bed specifically for Cen Wei to become so adept.\n\n*We cannot allow that old woman to get away with that bracelet. It is Bai Jing's artifact!*\n\n*I figured. You wouldn't go batshit over some random piece of jewelry.* Jiaojiao bounced carefully on the newly repaired *kang*. *Speaking of which, why is the bracelet here? If it belongs to Bai Jing, then doesn't that mean she showed up after all?*\n\nGuang Qiu was silent. Digesting this piece of news. \n\n*Unless of course, you're wrong and that bracelet is just an ordinary piece of jewelry.*\n\n*No, I cannot be wrong about this,* Guang Qiu said. *I don't know why it is here, but this is good news for you. You will be able to heal your leg and cure your poison with that bracelet.*\n\nBai Jing's bracelet was far from as simple as its appearance suggested. Her mother, the latest heir to an ancient mystical clan, famous for their skills in Chinese medicine, had gifted it to Bai Jing shortly before being murdered by her husband, Bai Jing's father, for control of the Bai family-- not to be confused with the Shaofu realm Bai Family. Anyway, it was all Very Sad.\n\nBai Jing hid away the bracelet, having been told by her mother that it harbored a very special secret. All through the years she was consigned to a death camp by her own father, she never spoke of it, despite his repeated attempts to persuade the answer out of her. After all, Bai Jing had been the sole witness to her mothers murder at her father's hands. \n\nBai Jing could only watch helplessly as her father took control of her mother's clan and all its businesses. Could only look as her father swiftly married his secret mistress, even bringing home a half-sister the same age as her. Could only keep to herself and plot revenge in the dark while her half-sister lived in the light, taking everything that should have been hers.\n\nShe guarded against this den of vipers all her life, building up her own strength, hoping one day to burst out with a revenge worthy of the history books. She honed her skills killing her targets, each time imagining her own father's face as she cut them down, even as every move she made was at the discretion of *that man*. She spent every free moment learning about medicine, both western and eastern, not wanting to shame her clan's legacy, planning for the day when she would wrench control of the clan from her father's cold dead hands.\n\nWho knew that half-sister would send her lover to seduce Bai Jing in a strange bid for the rumored inheritance of the mystical Bai Family, causing Bai Jing to trip up in the dumbest way possible.\n\nHaving lost her life in such a hackneyed, cliched manner, Bai Jing was luckily saved by her mother's artifact. Inside slept a celestial tiger, which whisked her soul away to the world of Shaofu, where she was reborn as the crippled girl, Bai Xingyue.\n\nThe bracelet was a magical item that harbored a secret space inside that defied common sense. It had various features such as the ability to store food indefinitely with no chance of it degrading. Plants grew faster in this pocket dimension as well, and there was even a luxurious pavilion with a library of secret martial arts texts. Plants grew faster in the soil, an advantage that Bai Jing exploited throughout her career dominating the world of Shaofu. She would use the space to nurture medicinal plants, supplying her alchemy with an endless crop of ingredients. Not to mention there was a celestial tiger that would become Bai Jing's willing lackey and body guard during her more vulnerable days.\n\nIn other words, the space was an indispensable part of Bai Jing's strength.\n\n*Tonight, when she has gone to bed, you will sneak into her room--*\n\n*Oh sure,* Jiaojiao said. *Just watch me, I'll be shadow itself with this bum leg.*\n\n*Bai Jing would--*\n\nJiaojiao massaged her forehead. *Not Bai Jing, Hello? Have you been paying attention at all?*\n\nGuang Qiu's light levels dimmed, and the room simmered in its discontent. *You will get that bracelet one way or another. You must. Or I will get rid of you.*\n\nJiaojiao covered her mouth as a yawn forced tears from her eyes. \"Can I do it later? I'm tired. Besides, she said she's going out for errands and it's not like this body is capable of running her down.\"\n\nThe ball's angry reply was lost as Jiaojiao laid back on the *kang* and fell asleep in a daze. \n\n*Isekai. Why did I have to be isekai'ed?* Jiaojiao's tired mind spiraled, confused. *Clearly I haven't even brushed the bumper of a white truck or crossed paths with an insane slasher? Why me? Isn't this sort of bullshit supposed to happen to virgin salarymen?*\n\nJiaojiao hadn't had a perfect life, but it was damn close. She was rich, famous, and admired by 13 million fans at the lastest count. She didn't lack for anything. She was a trust-fund baby for fucks sake, she didn't have any of the hallmarks typical of isekai victims. She wasn't disastified with the status quo. She had no outstanding traumas. She wasn't bullied, aside from some of the more poisonous voices denoucing her as shallow, fake, etc, she hadn't encountered much negativity at all. In fact, she was often praised for being young and successful--though some bitter voices would attribute all her accomplishments to her background as the young heir to the huge MEI conglomerate.\n\nShe had friends. Well, maybe they weren't quite as genuine as some, but she had a wide circle of acquaintances who were (somewhat) invested in her wellbeing. And she had...\n\nDevika. She had forgotten Devika. She had to ask Guang Qiu if she was okay. If whatever killed her had killed Devika too, then where was she?\n\nHow had she died anyway? She hadn't had the chance to ask Guang Qiu in all the chaotic aftermath of her sudden transmigration.\n\n*Isn't transmigration trendy?* Jiaojiao thought, somewhat hysterically to herself. *And I pride myself on being trendy, right? Maybe it's a little tired, but people still like reading about it, right?*\n\nThe kang creaked as Jiaojiao's body turned fitfully, her mind unable to rest as she fell deeper into dreams. \n\n*She looks out the broken window, rubble crumbling over the edges of the sill. Dust lingered in the cracks and crevices between the stones. Ivy trails curled and spun over the walls. She sees a shimmering valley in the distance, but she knows there is nothing there for her. She turns away and treads familiar steps down the corridor, shattered stone litters the path but she steps over them with practiced footwork.*\n\n*Checkered sunlight streams across the hall. Dusty footprints chase her steps. Not a sound is made. She comes to a door, half open, half closed. She pushes past and walks inside into a room with only one occupant. He is waiting for her, as he always is.*\n\n*I died today. But you weren't there.*\n\n*He doesn't speak. He never does. But he smiles.*\n\nJiaojiao woke in a start as someone shook her awake.\n\n\"Yueyue! Did you sleep well?\"\n\nJiaojiao held her head, still half lost in dreams. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\"Yueyue,\" Cen Wei shook her again, rougher this time. \"It's time for dinner.\"\n\nGuang Qiu popped into existence by her ear just as Jiaojiao was about to take her first bite.\n\n*Don't eat it. There's poison!*\n\nJiaojiao ignored it and took a difficult mouthful of worm-eaten cabbage.\n\nThe ball seemed shocked into silence. For all of two seconds. Then it screamed. *What are you doing?! Did you not hear me, mortal? Poison! I said there is poison!*\n\n*I heard you.* Jiaojiao shot back irritably. *What do you think the old woman would do if I refused to eat? Didn't you say I had to keep a good relationship with her for The Plot? Besides, this body is on the verge of keeling over from starvation. If you want me to be of any use, don't I need the strength?*\n\n*You are eating poison,* the ball retorted. *It's already killing you. I did a scan of your body as you slept--*\n\n*Um, invasive much?*\n\n*And the body is not long for this world if the rate of poison is not stemmed.*\n\n*Well, the body has been poisoned all its life,* Jiaojiao reasoned. *One more meal won't kill it.*\n\nGuang Qiu grumbled some more, but didn't refute this.\n\nJiaojiao choked down another half bowl of gruel before she couldn't force herself to go on, honestly she was proud that she had done as well as she had.\n\n*This has been the worst day of my life,* Jiaojiao told the ball with a dreary resignation as she watched Cen Wei rinse out the bowl in a bucket of well water-- not the same bucket she had used earlier that day thankfully. \n\n*You are too pampered,* the ball sneered. *You call this much suffering? How soft you are.*\n\nJiaojiao didn't argue. She was indeed a pampered, soft, and delicate existence. The worst thing she'd eaten prior to today had been a slightly sour yogurt she'd left in the fridge too long.\n\n\"Cen Wei,\" Jiaojiao said suddenly. \"Can I see a doctor about my leg?\"\n\nThis entreaty was enough for Cen Wei to drop a bowl. It shattered in half on the cobblestones and the pieces wobbled back and forth, emitting sounds like jeering laughter.\n\n\"What?\" Cen Wei, eyes wide. \"You want to fix your leg?\"\n\n\"Is something wrong?\" Jiaojiao asked. \n\n\"You can't!\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"There--\" Cen Wei licked her lips. \"There's no money.\"\n\nJiaojiao didn't speak.\n\n\"Besides, why would you want to fix your leg? It's been so long, miss. I'm afraid...\"\n\nThe rest went unspoken, but the implication was there. That the leg was too far gone to fix. That she should be content to spend the rest of her life a cripple. Cen Wei's deliberately bitter smile was ripe with untold sympathy.\n\n*Hey she makes a good point,* Jiaojiao said to Guang Qiu. *We're broke.*\n\nJiaojiao could almost hear the ball's scream of frustration.\n\n*We will cross that bridge when we come to it.* \n\nJiaojiao shrugged, then hobbled toward the outhouse.\n\n\"Do you need help, young miss?\" Cen Wei said, relief evident in her voice that her master had dropped the subject.\n\n\"I'll be fine,\" Jiaojiao said.\n\nGuang Qiu had excused itself the second Jiaojiao made moves toward the outhouse, no doubt afraid of mortal filth. But Jiaojiao didn't enter the outhouse. Instead, she hesitated for a long, long moment before picking up the three-foot long shovel leaning against the side, expression fraught with distress.\n\nShe hefted the smooth handle, trying her damndest to ignore the stench wafting off the rusted iron head. Flecks of... matter remained despite its bath earlier in the day. *Don't think about it, don't think about it.*\n\nCen Wei was still scrubbing dishes when Jiaojiao quietly came up behind her and whacked her in the head with the shovel. She fell forward, but caught herself on the edge of the bucket in front of her. Expression livid, she turned in time to catch the second hit with her forehead. \n\n\"Yueyue!\" She screamed, holding her face. Jiaojiao hit her again. It took five hits before the old woman finally slumped over into unconciousness.\n\nJiaojiao frowned, looking at the old woman collapsed facedown on the ground, then the shovel. \"What the hell is her head made of?\"\n\nGuang Qiu chose this moment to pop back into existence. *Mortal! What have you done!?*","lastmodified":"2022-04-29T11:35:13.400702706Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/Chapter06-The-Impasse":{"title":"Chapter 06-The Impasse","content":"Jiaojiao tossed the shovel aside with revulsion and wiped her stinging hands on Cen Wei's gray robes, paying no mind to Guang Qiu's enraged screams ringing in her mind.\n\n*Mortal! Didn't I say not to get in conflict with the old woman? Why did you attack her, you imbecile?!*\n\n*Sometimes I really do wonder if you have two brain cells to rub together, or whether you have braincells at all,* Jiaojiao retorted as she flipped the woman around with difficulty. She summoned all eighty-five pounds of leverage, sweat beading on her brow. *Perhaps you don't have a brain at all in that child's nightlight you call a body.*\n\n*Now what will happen to the fateline?* Guang Qiu seemed to be mostly talking to itself. *It's already bad enough that the scene with Bai Xingwu didn't go as intended!*\n\nJiaojiao rifled in the the woman's sleeves, but came up empty. *The bracelet isn't in her sleeves.* She informed Guang Qiu.\n\nA small bout of distressed silence. *Then go look for it! Doesn't she live in the other hovel over there?*\n\n*I can't just leave her here. What if she wakes up and comes after me?*\n\nGuang Qiu's grumbling reached a deafening crescendo as Jiaojiao ventured into the storehouse, the third building in the courtyard. She squinted in the low light of the setting sun and located a coil of moldy rope on a low shelf and sneezed when picking it up raised a small cloud of dust. Waving a hand in front of her face, she retreated with the heavy length of hemp rope, most likely reserved for roof repairs.\n\nShe spent the next ten to fifteen minutes securing Cen Wei's prone form, binding her arms close to her body and tying her legs together. She was thankful Bai Xingyue's courtyard was deserted, not knowing how she would explain herself should someone stumble onto the scene of her binding her unconscious servant.\n\n*This is not good,* Guang Qiu fretted. *What of the plot?*\n\n*For real? You should just accept that the plot had been miscarried the moment you decided to yeet me into this body,* Jiaojiao said, tying off the last the rope and clapping the filth off her hands. *Besides, we would have had to make a move against her sooner or later.*\n\n*I fail to see your reasoning. Bai Jing managed to keep an amiable relationship with the old woman, why couldn't you do the same?*\n\nJiaojiao was once again reminded that Guang Qiu wasn't the most farsighted of beings. *My guess is that Cen Wei was always rotten, but when Bai Jing showed up, she frightened Cen Wei into hiding her true nature when she beat up Bai Xingwu.*\n\n*So this is your fault!* The ball cried.\n\n*Hey, don't try to blame this on me. You're the one who put me here knowing I was but an \"entertainer,\" what exactly did you expect? That I would subdue them with my eyelash curlers?*\n\n*I still think it would have been better to sneak into her room--*\n\n*God, you just never quit! Even if I somehow managed to get the bracelet from her, what then? You saw her attitude. She would have likely detained us if we tried to leave. How would we get this leg fixed if we were confined to the courtyard? Even with the magic bracelet, I have no medical training. You expect me to fix this leg myself? And I highly doubt she would have been kind enough to invite a doctor. Besides... if my thoughts are correct...*\n\nJiaojiao once again turned a deaf ear to Guang Qiu's complaints as she pushed open the door to the servant's quarters. She thought she would be met with more depressing sights of decrepitude and poverty, but she was surprised to find Cen Wei's room to be in good condition-- at least compared to the rooms she'd spend the day in.\n\n*Tsk, this old woman sure had double standards,* Jiaojiao laughed as she took in the fluffy covers on the servant's *kang*. They weren't silk, like the ones on Bai Xingyue's bed, but at least the cotton wasn't half-eaten by moths or damp with pond water. The space was simple, but the furniture was in good repair, with a minimal amount of wear. Though of simpler make than the furniture in Bai Xingyue's quarters, they were at least not on the verge of falling apart with a slight bump.\n\nBai Xingyue really had lived an unjust life. Even her servant lived better than her. The ceiling didn't even have as many missing roof tiles. Jiaojiao even wondered if Cen Wei had misappropriated some of her mistresses roofing tiles for her own abode.\n\nThe covers were turned over as Jiaojiao searched for the thing she suspected was secreted away by Cen Wei.\n\n*Found it,* Jiaojiao said with a smile.\n\n*Well done, mortal, you found the artifact?*\n\n*No,* Jiaojiao held up the embroidered pouch, heavy and clinking in her hands. *Cash.*\n\n*You imbecile, how can this mortal pittance compare with the magical space--*\n\n*Hey idiot? Do you think doctors work for free? I'm guessing subsidized healthcare isn't a thing here.*\n\nA sullen hum. *What of the artifact?*\n\nJiaojiao turned over the rest of Cen Wei's items, but unfortunately the bracelet was nowhere to be found.\n\n*My guess is that the old woman pawned it this afternoon when she left. She really didn't waste any time. Some of the silver here is what she got in return,* Jiaojiao bounced the heavy pouch in her hands.\n\n*That old wretch! Now we have to waste more time tracking it down.* Guang Qiu cried. *I've a mind to do away with her!*\n\nJiaojiao smiled. *Do away?*\n\n*Yes,* the ball said to itself. *If she remains, it will be more of a problem. Go on, you've already done the damage when you decided to create a hostile relationship with her. Just go out and... hit her a few more times. You won't even have to risk your life.*\n\n*I'm not killing someone,* Jiaojiao said.\n\n*What?!* Guang Qiu drew back, as if the declaration against murder was somehow offensive. *What do you mean?*\n\n*I'm not a murderer,* Jiaojiao said. *You're not going to convince me to kill someone.*\n\n*You already hit her, what difference does it make if you hit her again?*\n\n*Uh, loads. I'm not going to get into this debate with you.*\n\n*This is a ridiculous conversation.*\n\n*Wow! Something we can agree on!*\n\n*If you hope to survive in this world, you will have to get over your squeamishness. You can't avoid killing forever. Bai Jing would have done it without even blinking.*\n\n*I'm getting really sick of hearing about Bai Jing. If she's so great, why isn't she here? Why am I stuck with her problems? Why am I stuck here with you?*\n\n*Don't forget, mortal, I am the sole reason you live and breath! You cannot defy me!*\n\n*Oh yeah? Go ahead, smite me. Just punish me for refusing to kill some defenseless old woman.*\n\nGuang Qiu didn't move.\n\n*You can't, can you? For all your blustering you can't do jack. If you could, you would have punished me already for not listening to you earlier.*\n\n*Mortal...*\n\n*This mortal doesn't have to do anything she doesn't want to. And she doesn't want to kill. So seriously, fuck off.*\n\n*Mortal, you will think twice before crossing me!* The ball warned.\n\n*I already have. And I don't think you're that much at all,* Jiaojiao scoffed. *You haven't done a thing to me since I woke up but scream at me to do things. And for what? With the threat of death? Newsflash, buddy! I'm already dead!*\n\n*You are alive right now.*\n\n*No, I'm pretty sure I'm fucking dead, and this is hell, with scenarios engineered just to torture me. No running water, no internet, no take-out, and everyone, EVERYONE, IS TRYING TO KILL ME.*\n\nJiaojiao was tired of it. She prided herself on her composure, but enough was enough. She had used an outhouse for gods sake. She'd touched a poo shovel with her bare hands. She'd eaten worm food. She'd even kowtowed today! What the hell was that?? She didn't know, but it wasn't living.\n\n*Besides, even if I do what you say, what's in it for me?* Jiaojiao shook her head. *Don't even try to con me with \"you get to live, mortal\" or some shit.*\n\nGuang Qiu vibrated, then fell silent.\n\n*I don't get anything out of listening to you, but more of this. And let me be real with you, it's not enough.*\n\n*Then what do you want?*\n\nBingo. *Well, is it possible for me to be sent back to my own worl--*\n\n*Impossible!* The ball said immediately. *I don't have the power to do so.*\n\n*That's going to be a tough sell for me, man.* Jiaojiao scoffed. *You pulled my soul over, don't tell me you can't send me back. I told you not to bullshit me.*\n\n*You don't understand,* the ball explained irately. *The passage between worlds is usually closed. Even today was a very rare case when the celestial bodies aligned just so. It was enough for Bai Jing to slip through. When she didn't come, and the passage was moments from closing, we had to take measures to find a comparable soul to fill her place.*\n\n*Comparable?* Jiaojiao pointed at herself. *You're saying me and Bai Jing are comparable? In what way?*\n\nRealizing he might have said too much, Guang Qiu hunkered down. *None of your business, mortal.*\n\n*That's interesting,* Jiaojiao said. *That is to say there are souls of different calibers? What is the criteria? It can't be that an assassin and an... entertainer have much in common at all, yet you used the word comparable. Intriguing.*\n\n*Stop thinking so much!*\n\nJiaojiao began to think. What did she have in common with Bai Jing? Certainly, neither of them could be considered average people. They were both *intelligent, beautiful,* and influential young women, both famous in their own circles, both rich, both Chinese-- though Jiaojiao only qualified by half, being a mix-breed with a Russian father. They were both skilled in their fields, though Guang Qiu would probably sneer to compare the art of blending foundation, to the art of the garrote.\n\nWas that where the similarities ended? Not really. \n\nFor one, they both had an ancient ancestry, though the earthly Bai Family (again, not to be confused with the Bai Family of Lan country) bore a mystical background as ancient practitioners of medicine. The MEI conglomerate's origins were far more mundane. They were businessmen, or merchants to use the more archaic term, a social class that was at the very bottom in ancient China, often met with censure and derision. And this attitude had not changed until the last two centuries or so. \n\nThen what were the differences? Not as much as the similarities anyway. Bai Jing had suffered from a childhood of abuse while Jiaojiao had been raised in the lap of luxury. This was the biggest difference between them, Jiaojiao thought. Bai Jing was used to suffering, and Jiaojiao, well. She was used to going with the path of least resistance. If there was an easier way, then that was the way she was going. Why suffer needlessly, after all?\n\nIf Jiaojiao had to put it crudely, they were both one in a million in terms of their life experiences.\n\nIn other words, people like them didn't just die everyday.\n\n*How did I die, Guang Qiu?* Jiaojiao asked.\n\n*...I believe it's called carbon monoxide poisoning, in your world.*\n\n*Of all the dumb...* Jiaojiao trailed off didn't speak for a long, long time. *Did anyone else die in the same incident that I did?*\n\n*Why does this matt--*\n\n*Just tell me!*\n\nGuang Qiu drew back at her vehemence *What!? How should I know? I grabbed the first soul I saw that could be used, I didn't stop to look around!*\n\nJiaojiao kept a hand at her neck, hand habitually grasping for something that wasn't there. She frowned, deep in thought. Where did that leave her? If Devika was dead, then why did she get to live? What made her so worthy? Was the world really this unfair?\n\n*Who's Devika?* Guang Qiu asked.\n\nJiaojiao glared. *I thought you couldn't hear my thoughts.*\n\n*You were thinking too loudly,* Guang Qiu said disdainfully. *Don't presume to think I would eavesdrop. Why would I stoop so low just to have a peek at a mere mortal's thoughts?*\n\n*She's my roommate,* Jiaojiao explained shortly. *If what you said is right, then she's probably dead too.*\n\nCarbon monoxide was colorless, tasteless, and the only symptoms that would generally manifest were dizziness, headaches and an upset stomach. No wonder she hadn't seen it coming. She'd merely blown it off as a flu. \n\n*Mortals. So fragile,* Guang Qiu said in liu of sympathy. *Don't take it so hard, she would have been dead in a mere fifty to sixty years anyway.*\n\n*As if fifty years is a trivial sampling of time!*\n\n*It is for me,* Guang Qiu said loftily.\n\nJiaojiao shook her head. She was asking too much if she thought this dumb ball could be understanding.\n\n*I have something I want, but I don't know if you can give it to me,* Jiaojiao said finally.\n\n*What?* The ball vibrated in impatience.\n\n*If you can bring me back to life, then you can bring others back to life too, correct?*\n\n*Absolutely not!* The ball cried, it's shape fuzzy and spiked with agitation. *You think this is a game? I won't do it, you can just give up that fanciful dream this instant!*\n\n*What's the matter?* Jiaojiao crossed her arms. *You resurrected me just fine. What's stopping you from doing it again for someone else?*\n\n*I wouldn't have bothered to do so if I were not compelled by extenuating circumstances! You think the cycle of reincarnation can just to flouted at a mortal's whim?*\n\n*Then I guess we have nothing to talk about,* Jiaojiao said. Her eyes were dark as she left the irate Guang Qiu to hobble into the darkened courtyard.","lastmodified":"2022-04-29T11:35:13.400702706Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/Chapter07-The-Stuttering-Concubine":{"title":"Chapter 07-The Stuttering Concubine","content":"A girl and a glowing ball stood over the prone form of an old woman in a deserted courtyard. The two stared down at the bound figure in silence, neither willing to be the first to speak after their apparent fall-out.\n\n*What do you intend to do with her?* The glowing ball asked finally. \n\n*What can be done?* Jiaojiao answered in a clipped manner. *I'm not going to kill her, don't ask me to do it again.*\n\n*We can't just leave her here,* the ball protested. *She's going to wake up eventually. What will you do then? What if she attacks you? Then what? With your current body you won't last two slaps from her. Even though this old thing is the bottom of the barrel in terms of strength, you are more feeble than a chicken.*\n\n*Don't put the faults of the body on me. It was in this state when I got here.*\n\n*And your original body was any better?* The ball sneered. \n\n*It could at least walk ten steps without getting dizzy.*\n\n*We seem to have gone off-topic,* the ball said. *What will you do when she wakes up?*\n\n*Well, if you want to see that damned bracelet again, I'm going to have to ask her what she's done with it.*\n\nThe ball fell silent, strangled.\n\n*If I'd gone ahead and killed her like you wanted where would I even know to look? Truly stupid.*\n\n*Mortal! You will show me the respect I'm due!*\n\nJiaojiao shook her head, then limped into the store room again, nearly tripping over a broken hoe. A bygone tool for a bygone time when the courtyard still had a viable garden she supposed. Further rummaging revealed more moldy twine and some rags that might have once been linens. Jiaojiao held them at arms length, dropping them in a pile next to Cen Wei. \n\nJiaojiao located a pair of rusty scissors in Cen Wei's quarters and snipped the piles of cloth into lengths that could be used to further bind the old woman. She made a game of cocooning the unconscious Cen Wei in swathes of smelly rags, grunting as she rolled the woman this way and that, taking petty revenge for all the times she'd felt belittled as she was manhandled by the old woman in the past day.\n\n*I think that's enough* the ball interrupted. *She is but a martial apprentice. This should be more than enough to hold her.*\n\nJiaojiao nodded, wiped the sweat from her brow with her sleeve, then dusted off her hands. She grabbed the bucket full of dirty dish water with difficulty and lugged it to the prone Cen Wei, dragging a trembling leg behind her. All the activity had set it afire with pain, but Jiaojiao grit her teeth and bore it. With more precarious maneuvering, she took a bowl and used it to splash dirty water onto the old woman's face.\n\nThe woman groaned, but did not wake. Another splash of water yielded similar results.\n\n*I think I might have hit her too hard.*\n\n*Well done,* the ball said sarcastically. *If you've killed her after all then what? After all that talk of not killing, you might have done the old woman in anyway. Splendid!*\n\nJiaojiao frowned and lifted one of the old woman's eyelids. Her pupils were blown out, and slightly uneven in size. She let the eyelid snap shut, and pushed down a very very slight pang of guilt.\n\n*Well, I'm no expert, but she seems concussed. I think she'll be fine. From what I understand, it's rare for you cultivators to die of something so small. Didn't people in the book bounce back from much worse?*\n\n*You're not wrong,* the ball said after a long moment. *I did a small scan. She will most likely be awake by noon tomorrow.*\n\nWhat was this scanning business? Jiaojiao wondered to herself. \n\n\"Ex-excuse me.\"\n\nJiaojiao turned to see a face peering at her and the fallen Cen Wei from the hole in the courtyard wall. The same face she'd spotted earlier in the day.\n\n\"She fell,\" Jiaojiao said.\n\nThe face didn't seem too know how to respond to this. \"Th-then, you-- I--\"\n\n*Excellent excuse,* the ball said. *I think she believes you.*\n\n\"What do you want?\" Jiaojiao asked.\n\n\"I-I was just...\" the face sputtered. \"I-- I know she's not a g-good woman. I saw y-you hit her, b-but don't w-worry, I w-won't tell anyone.\"\n\nJiaojiao limped closer to the wall. The face seemed taken aback, and almost seemed ready to make a run for it at her approach. \n\nIt was a beautiful face, delicate and smooth, with sparkling eyes, thought they were currently darting back and forth nervously. The young woman had red lips and even teeth. She was a great beauty, and Jiaojiao could not help staring, trying to rank the young woman on her personal list of outstanding faces. It was even more impressive given that plastic surgery was non-existent in this world.\n\n\"Top twenty for sure.\"\n\n\"W-what?\" The woman blinked at her. \n\n\"It's nothing.\"\n\n*Who is she?* Jiaojiao asked Guang Qiu.\n\n*...I don't know,* the ball responded after a long moment. *I don't think she is mentioned in the book at all.*\n\n\"Wh-what are y-you going to d-do now?\" the woman asked, anxiously holding an embroidered sleeve to her mouth. \"That old s-servant has been b-bought off by Head W-wife Zh-zhang. Sh-she won't b-be h-happy...\"\n\n*You need to stop speaking with her,* the ball cautioned. *You aren't supposed to meet this person at all.*\n\nWell, now she *had* to speak to this woman!\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\n\"I-I'm,\" the woman jolted back as if shocked. \"I'm a con-concubine of Family Head B-bai. I m-moved in-into this c-c-courtyard l-last month.\"\n\nWhat a way to refer to your own husband. Jiaojiao had almost forgotten that this was an era with very unbalanced gender roles. A man could own as many women as he could afford while a woman... heh. Plumbing didn't exist, but the patriarchy was alive and well!\n\n\"Bai Qinghan?\" Jiaojiao fished the name from the text in her head.\n\nThe woman's eyes widened. \"Y-you can't sp-speak your f-father's n-name like that! It's im-improper!\"\n\nJiaojiao almost rolled her eyes, but didn't want to further scandalize the stuttering beauty. What if she bit herself?\n\n\"Why did you call out to me?\" Jiaojiao asked instead.\n\n\"I was w-worried about y-you.\"\n\nJiaojiao wasn't sure she believed her. If she'd moved into the courtyard a month ago, then she must have seen her fair share of Bai Xingyue's suffering. \"Why now?\"\n\n\"You- you've k-kicked a h-hornet's nest now, b-by acting against the old w-woman. Head Wi-wife Zhang won't l-let this go. Y-you are in d-danger.\"\n\nHead Wife Zhang. What was she, some kind of end boss? \"I was always in danger.\"\n\n\"Y-you've never f-fought b-back before today. It's d-different. Y-you're,\" the woman gave her a meaningful gaze, \"you're d-different.\"\n\n\"I didn't have a choice. She was poisoning me and refused to get a doctor to look at my leg.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" the woman ducked her head. \"Th-that's awful of h-her. I a-always thought sh-she was a t-terrible person. Th-the way she tre-treated you.\"\n\n*Did you hear me!?* Guang Qiu roared. *Stop talking! Don't interact with irrelevant people!*\n\n\"I actually do need help,\" Jiaojiao said. \"Can you find a way to get a doctor to me?\"\n\n\"I--\" the woman looked down. \"I-I'm s-ss-sorry, but I c-can't do that.\"\n\nTsk.\n\n\"B-but, I have a way to g-get you o-out of the e-estate.\"\n\nJiaojiao smiled. \n\n\"B-but I d-don't think y-you should do it,\" the woman's eyes blinked rapidly. \"It's not a s-safe place out there for a y-young lady.\"\n\nJiaojiao gestured at her face. \"If you're worried about people taking advantage of me, as you can see...\"\n\nThe woman blushed charmingly, blood red and beguiling. \"I-I'm--you--\" she looked anywhere but at Jiaojiao's face. \"Being b-beauti-f-f-ful isn't e-every-thing.\"\n\nJiaojiao dissected her words, wondering why the woman was blushing for a dumbfounded moment. Was it because Jiaojiao spoke of being assaulted? Because she was embarrassed on Jiaojiao's behalf for her ugliness? And how dare she say that? Beauty was everything!\n\nJiaojiao built a career from beauty, and felt a bone-deep irritation at hearing this statement. Maybe the woman could feel how hypocritical she was being, speaking to her with that face?\n\nWell, whatever, it wasn't really any of her business. This was after all, *not her face.*\n\n\"Cen Wei pawned something really important of mine today,\" Jiaojiao said after an awkward silence. \"Do you have any idea where she might have taken it?\"\n\n\"Oh, well, \" the woman played with a strand of her hair, brow furrowed delicately. \"I'm not sure, but I think my first guess would be to try Yixin street. It has the most pawn shops. If you ask one by one, you are bound to find it sooner or later?\"\n\n*Good job, mortal! The end is in sight!* Guang Qiu cried, pulling an abrupt one-eighty.\n\n*Yeah? What happened to \"don't talk to irrelevant people\" huh?*\n\nGuang Qiu didn't dignify her with an answer. \n\n\"How long is this street? How many pawn shops are we talking?\"\n\n\"Well, it can't be more than fifty shops, surely?\"\n\n\"*Fifty shops?*\"  Jiaojiao echoed incredulously. \"Is the city nothing but pawn shops?\"\n\nThe woman laughed, a delightful clarity to her voice. \"Have you never been into the city? There's--\" then her eyes darted to the mark on her face and her laughter died. \"I'm s-sorry, I sh-shouldn't laugh. The c-city is very l-large. Yi-yixin street is nothing b-but a t-tiny c-corner of it.\"\n\n\"Great, splendid,\" Jiaojiao grumbled. \"I suppose I'm expected to get there on foot?\"\n\n*Mortal, you cannot balk now. The artifact is of the utmost importance.*\n\n\"You c-could always hire a r-rickshaw,\" the woman said with a sympathetic glance at her leg. \"You c-can p-probably sneak away f-for a d-day with no-no one noticing. Unless of c-course the th-third miss comes l-looking for you.\"\n\nJiaojiao shook her head. A little girl with a misplaced crush was the least of her concerns right now. \n\n\"How will you get me out?\"\n\n\"Come to my courtyard tomorrow morning. This section of the estate is not in good repair... anyway, you will see.\"\n\nAfter that, the face in the wall disappeared from sight. The sun was setting, throwing gloomy shadows over the lonely courtyard. The dried leaves rustled in the corners of the walls when a stray wind teased them, sending a rasping whispers echoing along the empty space. Cold blew in with the dusk, Jiaojiao drew her shoulders up to her ears, an insistent ache troubled her bad leg with the drop in temperature.\n\nShe took a disinterested glance at the prone form, stewing in dirty dish water in the middle of the courtyard. Sympathy was hard worn when she remembered how her own body had spent the last night in sopping wet clothes. Those two \"meals\" that old woman had fed her didn't help her case either.\n\n\"Good night, old woman,\" Jiaojiao said, draping her moldy blanket over Cen Wei before entering the servant's quarters and throwing the door shut behind her.\n\n*You're going to just leave her out there?*\n\n\"I can't move her with this leg, you want to give it a try? Besides, didn't you want her dead? She's lucky I gave her a covering at all,\" Jiaojiao said testily. As the dark encroached, Jiaojiao fumbled for an old pottery lantern, sporting hairline cracks. It was nothing more that a dish with congealed animal fat, a half-burnt cloth wick sticking out the side. \n\n\"How do I light this?\" Jiaojiao asked Guang Qiu.\n\n*Stupid mortal, use the huo zhe zi!*\n\nAfter some condescending instructions, Jiaojiao managed to use the antiquated old tube to produce a flame and touch it to the lamp wick. Jiaojiao squinted in the flickering light, displeased at the inadequate light levels and the smell of rancid fat sizzling away. She sorely missed modern lamps.\n\n\"How do people live like this?\"\n\n*Stop whining, it's just a little dark.*\n\n\"A little dark?\" Jiaojiao shook her head, rummaging in Cen Wei's things for a needle and thread. \"People would go blind working in these conditions. The eye strain is unbelievable.\"\n\n*Are you planning on staying here for the night?*\n\n\"It's not like the original occupant is using it. Besides, it's far cleaner than that mess in the other residence-- don't even start, I know what you're about to say, but why do I have to live in that miserable shack? Even Bai Jing didn't sleep there.\"\n\n*Heh, you have the gall to speak of Bai Jing?* Guang Qiu hovered over Jiaojiao, it's smoky form gloomy like a thundercloud. *Bai Jing would have bound the bracelet right now and contracted the White Tiger guardian. She would have entered the space and spent the night there!*\n\n\"*Not Bai Jing*,\" Jiaojiao sang.\n\n*If you had done something instead of letting f the bracelet slip through your fingers--*\n\nJiaojiao turned a deaf ear, busy inspecting the primitive sewing kit laid out before her. It came nestled in a plain wooden box, but all the necessary tools were there, including a set of metal needles and some plain off-white cotton thread. They weren't comparable to modern tools, but they would have to do.\n\n*--never in all my years have I seen such incompetence! I... what are you doing now?*\n\n\"Huh? Isn't it obvious?\" Jiaojiao smirked, expertly threading a needle. \"I'm doing what I do best.\"","lastmodified":"2022-04-29T11:35:13.400702706Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/Chapter08-Morning-and-Hu-Maoxun":{"title":"Chapter 08-Morning and Hu Maoxun","content":"Jiaojiao's eyelids creaked open, groaning as the dawn light slashed at her retinas like a scalpel. Distant birdsong filtered through the thin paper window, radiating cold. She moved her arms then hissed as her numb limbs responded with a prickling stab. She was half-bundled in Cen Wei's bed, slumped over a crumpled hanfu she'd spent half the night altering. The other half she'd slept fitfully, her head full of vague shadows and sad smiles. Her dozing mind took in the scene in front of her.\n\nFor a panicked moment, in between sleeping and waking, she thought she'd been kidnapped and thrown into a dingy location for safe-keeping. Then she remembered.\n\nGoddammit. She'd transmigrated.\n\nWait, was anything she'd just thought incorrect in essence? She shook out her dead arms, shooting a glare toward Guang Qiu, only to realize it was nowhere to be seen.\n\n\"Guang Qiu?\"\n\n*What?* came the instant, sullen reply. *Why are you making that face, mortal?*\n\nJiaojiao's crestfallen expression apparently irked the being, but she could not help hoping it had run out of battery or something. The fact that it had just been there, all night, waiting as she slept would never not be creepy.\n\n\"What do you do when I'm not awake?\" Jiaojiao asked. \"Did you just float there all night? Or did you sleep too?\"\n\n*I am beyond such needs. Don't mistake me for some feeble mortal.*\n\nHuh.\n\n*So don't get any funny ideas, mortal! I'll always be watching you!*\n\n\"Alright, simmer down, Sting.\" Jiaojiao stripped off her threadbare clothes, smirking as she sent the prudish Guang Qiu screaming out of the room. There had been a moment, as she worked, where she was astounded by how even her stitches were, given that they'd only been so-so in her past life. She chalked it up to the body's muscle memory, the previous occupant after all, probably did her share of mending clothes. Nevertheless, she was proud of what she'd accomplished in one night given that she had no access to a modern sewing machine, and she had done it by the light of an archaic lantern. \n\nHence the current ache in her eyeballs.\n\n\"Worth it,\" she told no one, as she dressed in the well-tailored gray robes, altered from the least distressed set found in Cen Wei's chest. It fit her scrawny figure perfectly, and while nothing could really flatter a stick-figure, she at least didn't look like a child playing dress-up. She'd even created a form-fitting mask from the scraps, maybe out of habit after going through the plague in modern times. Normally she'd balk at the thought of wearing used clothing, but literal beggars couldn't be choosers.\n\n*You spent all that time just for this? You* still *look like an impoverished peasant.* Guang Qiu ridiculed as he got a look at Jiaojiao's getup. \n\nAs a self-titled fashionista, Jiaojiao wouldn't be caught dead in sagging, loose-fitting robes. Well, dead again, since she had already died. At least she had been well dressed last time around since she made a point of looking sharp for her audience during streams. She would have died again in shame in the afterlife if she'd been found in her slouchy pajamas. She-- \n\nJiaojiao fell back onto the kang, shocked into silence.\n\n*Mortal! Are you all right?!* Guang Qiu flew over, radiating panic.\n\n\"I just realized, Guang Qiu.\"\n\n*What? What is it?*\n\n\"I hadn't finished my nails when I died,\" she turned to the ball, eyes hollow. \"What if they buried me with half-done nails?\"\n\nSilence.\n\n\"And what if they dress me in something awful? I don't trust my mother's fashion sense at all! What if--\"\n\n*Idiot!*\n\n\"It's not idiotic to want a dignified corpse!\" Jiaojiao gave the orb a scathing look. \"Not that you would understand, not having a body.\"\n\n*Is that something to be envied?* the ball sneered. *Even the best looking corpse becomes worm-food sooner or later.*\n\nJiaojiao was once again shocked into silence. She imagined that beautiful, perfect body of hers being boxed. Being lowered into the ground. Shriveling up and pickling in its own juices for years and years, decay stymied by embalming fluid. To the eventual collapse as rotting flesh split and cracked, unable to hold its integrity under the onslaught of time and a growing host of microorganisms.\n\n\"You bastard,\" Jiaojiao whispered, the ball's indignant rant about its need for respect drowned out by the ringing in her ears. It took five minutes for a brain to become unviable for resuscitation. How long had it been? Surely the body would have been found by now, along with whoever else had been unlucky enough to be caught in the gas leak. \n\nShe and Devika lived in a converted warehouse, so just the two of them probably.\n\n(This section better off in earlier chapters, don't mind me. Idiot author talking to self.)\n\nJiaojiao moved as if in a dream, the sights of her rotting corpse etched in her brain. She took a long detached glance at Cen Wei, lips blue and groaning and stuffed a ball of rags in her mouth. She secured the impromptu gag by fastening it behind the woman's head.\n\n*Why?*\n\n*She's waking up. What if she yells and alerts someone?*\n\nJiaojiao held her grumbling stomach. She adept at counting calories and would laugh if what she ate yesterday reached even a hundred units. Even so, her body didn't react to this much, being used to this level of near starvation, but this level of discomfort was enough to send Jiaojiao into a whining fit.\n\n\"I'm hungry,\" she told Guang Qiu. \"What do I do?\"\n\n*Are you slow? Go cook some food!*\n\n\"How?\" Jiaojiao asked. \"I don't even know where Cen Wei got the water.\"\n\nThere was a fraught silence. *Are you joking?*\n\n\"I'm from another world? With running water and indoor plumbing? Can you blame me for being ignorant?\"\n\n*There should be a well nearby.*\n\n\"You mean I have to literally draw water? From the ground? With this body? Forget it.\"\n\n*Then starve!*\n\n\"I already am!\"\n\nThe two bickered back and forth as Jiaojiao located the stone bucket that Cen Wei had used as a stove the day before. Next to it was the basket of wormy vegetables and a bag of inferior rice. She eyed the offerings with disgust but she was too hungry to refuse. She could light the fire and worry about the rest later. The awful noxious charcoal lay in a hemp bag in the storehouse. Jiaojiao fished out several handfuls and threw it in the bucket.\n\n\"What now? Do I just start a fire with the fire-stick?\"\n\n*You need tinder, you imbecile.*\n\nJiaojiao threw over that another handful of straw, then lit it on fire with the fire piston. The straw caught quickly, but soon died out. The charcoal remained dead and unlit.\n\n\"What did I do wrong?\"\n\n*How should I know? I'm not a mortal? Do you think I bother with such trivial things?*\n\nI'm going to die of starvation. I'll be the first to die of starvation after transmigrating. She gave Guang Qiu an angry look. \"Where is the justice? Other transmigrators get magic powers, a wise grandpa mentor, harems or artifacts but all I get is a broken leg and an ugly face.\"\n\n*You had an artifact! And you were the one who lost it!*\n\nBreakfast a lost cause, Jiaojiao donned a straw hat and grabbed a wooden pole she'd found in the storehouse as a cane. She wandered through the moon door leading out of the courtyard, hoping to cadge a meal from the stuttering concubine.\n\nShe made her way in the direction of the neighboring courtyard, but stopped short and shrunk back when she saw a young man in fine blue robes speaking with the woman from yesterday. He handed her a drawstring purse, then saluted before taking his leave, passing towards Jiaojiao's position. She hastily hid behind the edge of the moon door, breathing strangled when the footsteps paused right outside.\n\nThankfully, the young man didn't seem interested in investigating and left shortly after.\n\nJiaojiao waited for another three minutes before she felt safe leaving the confines of Bai Xingyue's courtyard, sneakily hobbling over to her destination. She didn't relish the thought of running into nosy servants or other residents of the estate and answering questions about why the resident disfigured shut-in was out and about.\n\n\"G-good, you m-made it,\" the stuttering concubine said, ushering her into her residence. Jiaojiao swallowed her questions about the young man. It really wasn't any of her business.\n\nJiaojiao took a curious look at the courtyard. It was identical to Bai Xingyue's in size in layout, but in far better repair. Even so, the age and overall neglect could not be dismissed. \n\nIt seemed that this section of the estate is reserved for those the Bai Family would prefer out of sight. No doubt the stuttering concubine was one such existence. Too pretty to throw away, but her speech impediment left her too embarrassing to be seen.\n\nJiaojiao's stomach gave a plaintive lurch as she laid eyes on the basket of steamed buns lounging on the low table in the reception room. The concubine caught her staring and tactfully gestured toward the table. \"Please, sit down and eat.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" Jiaojiao said, seating herself as gracefully as her damned leg would allow.\n\nThe two of them had breakfast in awkward silence.\n\n\"I didn't catch your name yesterday,\" Jiaojiao said, when she'd padded her stomach enough for it to stop screaming at her. \n\n\"I am Hu Maoxun,\" the young woman said, looking down with a blush.\n\n\"I suppose I don't need introduction, if you've been watching me for as long as you've lived here.\"\n\nThe woman had the decency to blush. \"I- it get's lonely here.\"\n\n\"It's fine, I'm not angry with you.\" Why would she be? It hadn't been her privacy being invaded for entertainment. \n\n\"Perhaps we should get going,\" the woman said. \"You don't have a lot of time.\"\n\nThey withdrew to the inner chamber where Hu Maoxun sat Jiaojiao down in front of an old vanity. \n\n\"You c-cannot go out as y-you are,\" her eye shifted over the mark on Jiaojiao's face. \"Your b-birthmark is far too r-recognizable.\"\n\nIndeed, the second young miss of the Bai Family was known far and wide as a horrifically ugly monster. An ongoing joke for being affianced to the crown prince.\n\nJiaojiao's eyes sparkled as Hu Maoxun placed a lacquer box on the vanity in front of her and opened the lid. Porcelein containers lay within with different shades of powder and rouge. \n\nJiaojiao looked from the containers of powder, each with paper seals untouched, then looked at Hu Maoxun's face. \n\nFine, it could be said that some people are simply blessed and do not need makeup to look good.\n\nHu Maoxun took the brush and started to apply the powder to Jiaojiao's face but Jiaojiao interrupted. \n\n\"Let me do it.\" Are you kidding? *Do you know who I am?*\n\nJiaojiao dipped the brush into the powder with an expert hand and began blending and dabbing her face, switching brushes with a dexterity that spoke of long familiarity. Hu Maoxun watched from the side, half in puzzlement and half in wonder as the girl's face went from horrifically disfigured to... well at least she was no longer disfigured.\n\nJiaojiao placed down the brush with a dissatisfied frown, turning her head to look back and forth. It would have to do, she supposed. The quality of the cosmetics were far from her usual standard. What she wouldn't give for liquid foundation and a beauty blender.\n\nThe two exited the residence and Hu Maoxun led her to a boarded up section of the wall. \n\n\"This leads to the outside,\" she said with some embarrassment, moving the board aside with a blush. \"You will have to crawl to get to the other side.\"\n\nJiaojiao looked at the hole. The wall was about six or seven inches thick, the other side covered with a shrub or bush.\n\nShe hefted her make-shift cane, forced a smile and gave Hu Maoxun a formal salute. \"I can't thank you enough for your help.\"\n\n\"It's n-nothing. I grow b-bored by myself. This was an a-amusing m-morning,\" Hu Maoxun suddenly pressed a cloth pouch into her hands. \"Please take this.\"\n\nJiaojiao looked down at it, recognizing it as the same pouch that young man had given Hu Maoxun that same morning. From the feel of it, it was filled with ingots. All this for an \"amusing\" morning? This little was considered amusing for the poor woman?\n\nJiaojiao took a proper look at the shy beauty, not know what to say. They didn't know each other at all, but Hu Maoxun was the first kind person she had encountered since waking up in this body.\n\n\"D-don't r-refuse, you will n-need the m-money if you w-want to fix your l-leg and retrieve the thing your s-servant pawned. I don't h-have much use for money...\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" Jiaojiao said simply, bowing again, this time more sincerely. \"I won't forget this.\"","lastmodified":"2022-04-29T11:35:13.400702706Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/Chapter09-The-Rickshaw-and-the-Clinic":{"title":"Chapter 09-The Rickshaw and the Clinic","content":"Jiaojiao, sweaty, irritated, and very unhappy, arrived at a deserted road half a mile from the outer wall of the Bai Estate. She cursed the Bai Family ancestors for choosing to establish their compound so far from a main road. There was no one in sight and she was already tired, her right leg a dead, agonized weight attached to her hip. Even Guang Qiu had fallen silent, content to watch her suffer. Or perhaps it had the decency to keeps its mouth shut.\n\n\"That's it, I can't go on,\" Jiaojiao announced, abruptly sitting down at the side of the road, uncaring of the dust and gravel underfoot.\n\n*You must,* Guang Qiu roared. *What of the artifact? Every second we delay some idiot mortal swoop in and take it!*\n\n\"Why are you so worried?\" Jiaojiao wiped the sweat from her neck with a sleeve, then held it at arms length, disgusted with her own actions, disgusted with the world in general. \"It's not as if anyone knows it's true value. It's just a wooden bracelet to all eyes but yours.\"\n\n*We cannot take the risk. If it slips through our grasp, what then?*\n\n\"Then I guess the universe doesn't want us to have the bracelet,\" Jiaojiao tapped her lap impatiently. \"What do you want me to do? I can't even move this leg right now.\"\n\nAs if on cue, a teenaged boy pulling a rickshaw behind him clattered around the bend in the road, head down as sweat streamed down his face. He was dressed in worn hemp clothes, even rougher than the ones Jiaojiao was wearing. She watched as the boy drew nearer and nearer, expelling a put upon sigh. Must she be forced to move?\n\n\"Wait,\" she called as the boy drew within earshot. \"I want to hire you!\"\n\nThe boy jerked his face up, surprised to see a person half-lying by the side of the road, no doubt. Face unsure, he stopped next to Jiaojiao. \"Where are you going?\"\n\n\"Do you know where I can find a reputable doctor?\"\n\n*Mortal!* Guang Qiu shrieked in her mind.\n\n\"I can take you to one,\" the boy said.\n\n\"How much?\"\n\nThe boy scanned Jiaojiao's form with a critical eye, taking in her altered servant's robes, dusty and damp with sweat, her straw hat, old and splintered. Her spirit over-taxed and woe-begone.\n\n\"Five coppers.\"\n\nJiaojiao wasn't an idiot. She could tell the boy had bumped up the price, but she was too lazy to argue and she was *tired*.\n\n\"Fine, fine,\" she stood with effort and fished a few copper coins from her sleeve. \"Half now, half upon arrival.\"\n\nThe boy grunted by way of agreement and pulled the cart back onto the road when Jiaojiao had seated herself. With a hop he took off running, his speed little affected by Jiaojiao's addition weight. Jiaojiao had no choice to be impressed by his physical fitness.\n\n*Mortal, what are you doing? Didn't we agree we would retrieve the artifact first?*\n\n*When did we reach this fictatious agreement?* Jiaojiao closed her eyes. The morning breeze wicking the sweat from her brow felt *heavenly*.\n\nGuang Qiu sputtered. *You--you--*\n\n*You know, Guang Qiu, I've only been in this world for a day, but I've had a lot of time to think about why I'm here.*\n\n*You will listen to me--*\n\nJiaojiao inspected her ragged nails. *I've come to a conclusion. Despite all your threats, I don't think you can do a thing to me.\n\n*Don't be so sure, mortal--*\n\nJiaojiao smiled to herself. She didn't have all the answers, but she had enough. From the scraps of information Guang Qiu dropped, she could ascertain that she possessed something that led Guang Qiu to choose her out of all of the dead souls on earth. If she was so easily replaced, she didn't doubt Guang Qiu would have switched her with the first gullible rando he could find. After all, why bother fishing back a soul from earth at all? Wouldn't it make more sense to grab a local that was familiar with this world? After all, it was painfully evident, *she* didn't know what the hell she was doing. She couldn't even feed herself!\n\nFurthermore, if what if it was specifically a soul from earth that was needed? Going by what Guang Qiu said, she had a long long time before the passage between worlds opened again and they found a replacement for her. What could happen in one thousand years? Two thousand years? Assuming she even lived that long. \n\nJiaojiao didn't care much for the idea of immortality. Especially immortality in a world with none of the modern necessities she so craved.\n\n\"Things are precious because they have an end,\" she sighed.\n\n\"What?\" the boy panted from the head of rickshaw. \"Did you say something?\"\n\n\"It's nothing,\" Jiaojiao replied, shaking her head. She took another admiring glance at the boy, huffing and puffing under weight of the rickshaw.\n\n*Why couldn't you have gotten me a body like his?* she asked Guang Qiu, who had gone as quiet as a strangled chicken. She immediately regretted engaging it as this seemed to light a fire under its metaphorical ass.\n\n*You dare speak to me thus?*  it thundered in her ear, buzzing and humming like an irate cellphone. *You will show me respect! If it were not for me, you would be dead! You should be grateful you have a body at all! I--*\n\n*Yes, yes, yes,* Jiaojiao interrupted. *You've made your point. Don't worry, the moment I finish seeing the doctor, I will go to Yixin street.*\n\n*Hah! Fool me once! As if I will believe your lies!*\n\n*Actually, I never lied.*\n\n*I will believe you if you make a vow!*\n\n*Why should I care if you believe me or not?*\n\n*I--I--*\n\nJiaojiao smiled.\n\n*I won't let you rest if you don't! Guang Qiu said triumphantly. *I will nag and nag until you do!*\n\nJiaojiao's face fell. \n\n*Hah, that will teach you to defy me-- see if I let you rest at all, if you don't listen to me. Just watch me! I don't need to rest, I can go all night! I will scream in your ear until dawn--*\n\nJiaojiao pinched the bridge of your nose. *That... sounds so wrong. Please stop.*\n\n*Well, mortal?*\n\nThere was a very good reason Jiaojiao was hesitant to make vows. In this blasted world she'd landed in, a person's vows had a real binding effect. Even if she was still a skeptic where magic was concerned, she didn't want to take the risk.\n\n*I vow to go to Yixin street after I see the doctor,*  Jiaojiao said finally with a scoff. *Happy?*\n\n*I would be* happy *if Bai Jing--*\n\n*My god, you little fan boy, just stop!*\n\nJiaojiao's enjoyment of the scenery was almost ruined by Guang Qiu's ongoing argument, but inner voice cut off as the rickshaw turned down a busy street. \n\nThe orderly streets spread open in front of her, hammering in the point that she was really in another world. Or at least, a very expensive movie set. She took in the bustling forms, the farmers hawking their wares, the armored guards standing on the corners of each street, the skeins of silk hanging in neat bunches outside of a dye shop. Chaotic voices called to one another through the crowds. A young child darted underfoot, a rattle drum grasped in one hand, their mother yelling after them to watch out for the carts.\n\n\"We're here,\" the boy said, lowering the poles with a grunt. \"It's that shop over there.\"\n\nJiaojiao placed the other half of the payment in his outstretched hand. \"If you have time, I have another job for you later, after I see the doctor.\"\n\nHe took the money and nodded, seemingly not much for words.\n\nJiaojiao hopped off the rickshaw, subtly patting her numb ass. The ancient roads left something to be desired and it wasn't as if the primitive rickshaw had shock absorbers. \n\nShe let herself through the open doors of the clinic, wrinkling her nose as the pungent smell of herbs assaulted her senses. She could practically taste the gingko on her tongue.\n\nThe shop was well-kept, with clean floors and counters, but there there was a noticeable stillness. The waiting area was empty and many of the drawers on the wall had been pulled out and stacked on the counter. A glance revealed nothing inside. Furthermore, there was no one in sight. \n\nJiaojiao hefted her staff and rapped the counter. \"Hello?\"\n\nA middle-aged man with a short beard and impatient frown stalked into view, his white robes cutting a stark figure. \"Don't scratch my counters, girl!\"\n\n*Okay then.* Jiaojiao lowered her staff. \"I'm here for a consultation.\"\n\nThe man raked a scathing glance over her dusty body. \"Do you have money?\"\n\n\"I have money.\"\n\nThe man held out his hand with a flourish of his long, flowing sleeves. \"Fifty silver ingots.\"\n\nJiaojiao stared at it. Did this man take her for a simpleton? Even if fifty silver ingots was a reasonable price, she didn't have fifty silver ingots to feed this gluttonous troll.\n\n\"Well?\" the man gestured impatiently. \"I don't have all day.\"\n\nJiaojiao smiled. \"That's funny. Neither do I.\"\n\n\"Did you come in here to play games? Give me the money or get out.\"\n\n\"Are you a beggar?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nJiaojiao's smile grew brighter. \"I said, are you a beggar?\"\n\n\"Outrageous!\" the man barked, his fist raised. \"How dare you? I am a doctor!\"\n\n\"Then act like one. All I see is a greedy old man eager to part a young girl from her money.\" \n\n\"You asked for a consultation, I don't run a charity.\"\n\n\"Do you see my youth, and perhaps think I am easy to cheat? I'll pay you after, not before.\"\n\n\"I will not tolerate this disrespect!\"\n\n\"Do you even have the skills?\" Jiaojiao took a pointed glance at the deserted waiting area.\n\nThe frown turned into one of wrath. \"You dare question my skills?\"\n\n\"I'm only returning rudeness for rudeness,\" Jiaojiao said.\n\n\"I am a doctor!\" the man said again.\n\nJiaojiao shook her head and turned to leave. \n\n\"Wait!\"\n\nJiaojiao didn't stop.\n\nA hand closed over her shoulder. She turned to glare at the man. \"Don't touch me.\"\n\n\"I will take a look at your leg,\" the man forced out through gritted teeth. \"That is why you are here, yes?\"\n\n\"I see you aren't blind.\"\"\n\nThe man audibly ground his teeth. \"Just promise you'll pay me afterward.\"\n\n\"We'll see.\"\n\nThe man withdrew his hand, gesturing for Jiaojiao to follow him to the back with an irritated jerk of his arm .\n\n*Why did he change his mind?* Guang Qiu said.\n\n*He badly needs money. You can see how run down this place is. There's no customers, and half the shelves are empty. My guess is he's about to close down. In other words he's very near desperation.*\n\n*Wait...*\n\n*Yes, if my guess is correct,* Jiaojiao's face turned solemn. *This man is Doctor Tai.*","lastmodified":"2022-04-29T11:35:13.400702706Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/Chapter10-The-Broken-Body":{"title":"Chapter 10-The Broken Body","content":"Jiaojiao sat there, a healthy amount of skepticism making itself known by her unenthused expression as the doctor felt her pulse at her wrist. He had placed a handkerchief between their hands, because *propriety*. Jiaojiao couldn't spare the energy to ridicule this excessive need for distance between the sexes. By what she'd gathered from the text, the physicians in this world had the ability to diagnose patients just by feeling their pulse. Bai Jing herself was an expert at this technique, demonstrated over and over by her various encounters with ill people, always with some affliction that left lesser doctors scratching their heads. These people, usually of rich and affluent backgrounds, were always left impressed by such a young doctor, showering her with accolades and favors. Even Doctor Tai, the man currently diagnosing her and a famous doctor in his own right, (though he was currently going through a rough patch) had been left awestruck, going so far as to call her *shifu.*\n\n*Indeed, the plot has been bent out of shape,* Guang Qiu lamented in her mind. *This disciple has been lost.*\n\nJiaojiao's mind wandered as the doctor furrowed his brow, concentrating on her pulse. She kept a paranoid eye on the outer area, lost in thought. *The text is a bit vague on this, but if what it says here is true, he should be in the palace for another few days.*\n\n*What was that mortal?*\n\n*Nothing.*\n\nDoctor Tai's eyes finally opened, shooting her an odd, scrunched look.\n\n\"Well?\" she asked, when he continued to stare.\n\n\"You,\" he said slowly, \"How are you even alive?\"\n\n*That's a really good question.* Jiaojiao almost laughed out loud. *Guang Qiu, do you think this guy is a psychic?*\n\n*Nonsense, there's nothing special about this mortal. Even his medical skills are only so-so--* Guang Qiu said.\n\n\"You have two different poisons running through you,\" Doctor Tai said haltingly, as if parsing a very difficult math problem. \"Either one should be enough to kill you, but to have both--\" a sharp look, \"--just who are you?\"\n\n*Cough, I suppose his skills aren't bad for such a backward realm,* Guang Qiu amended. \n\n*There's two poisons?* Jiaojiao said incredulously. *Just how much does Head Wife Zhang hate this girl?*\n\nGuang Qiu tsked in a rare moment of accord. *She is indeed a poisonous shrew.*\n\n\"I see your face has traces of powder. Is there perhaps a red mark on your face? Are perhaps also a martial cripp--\"\n\n\"Is this relevant?\" Jiaojiao deflected the man's peaking professional interest. \"I just came here to get my leg looked at.\"\n\n\"I'm a doctor,\" the man repeated, as if Jiaojiao were likely to forget, \"I take my job very seriously. You can't just ask me to ignore an aspect of my patient's health.\"\n\n\"Well, this patient is asking you to ignore it.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Just who is it that has the money here?\" Jiaoajiao gripped her staff as if she were ready to stand. \"Shall I take my business elsewhere?\"\n\n\"Very well,\" Doctor Tai  bit out. \"Keep your secrets. Roll up your pants.\"\n\nJiaojiao did so with difficulty, her right leg numb and unresponsive from her morning journey. \n\nThe man paused, taking in the horrific mess of old scar tissue and knotted flesh with clinical eyes. He draped the handkerchief over the old crooked break in the calf and began to poke and prod.\n\n\"Looks like a compound fracture, both tibia and fibula snapped. A clean break, but left untreated and complicated with infection. I'm surprised the leg hasn't rotten off your body. How old is this? About five years?\"\n\n*How should I know?* Jiaojiao complained. The book hadn't included many details on how or when Bai Xingyue had broken her leg, only stating that that her dear father had done the breaking. \n\n\"Wouldn't it be easier to look at without the cloth?\" She asked instead of answering.\n\nThe man shot her an affronted look. \"I am a gentleman!\"\n\nJiaojiao gave up. She would never understand the exaggerated modesty of the ancients.\n\nAfter what seemed like an hour, the doctor stood, wiping his hands even though they'd never touched flesh. \"I can reset the leg, but I can't promise you that you'll be able to walk any straighter afterward.\"\n\nJiaojiao squinted. \"How much?\"\n\n\"Fifty--\"\n\n\"You want to try that again?\"\n\nHe glowered. \"Twenty.\"\n\n\"Ten.\"\n\n\"Fifteen!\"\n\n\"Twelve.\"\n\n\"Thirteen! My final offer!\"\n\n\"Done.\" Jiaojiao said.\n\nHaving reached a deal, the doctor instructed her to lay flat on the platform, then handed her a wooden dowel about three fingers thick and a foot long. She took it with a puzzled glance.\n\n\"So you don't bite yourself.\"\n\nWhat the hell? \"What about anesthesia.\"\n\n\"Unavailable.\"\n\nJiaojiao had never stood faster in her life, gimp leg or no. \"I think I'll find another doctor.\"\n\n\"Do you seriously thing you'd be able to find another willing to help you? Remember the poison you have running through your veins? They'll take one look and decide they won't want to mess with anyone who has enemies powerful enough to afford heartbreak ganoderma *and* meridian shattering grass,\"\n\nJiaojiao stopped, half sitting, half crouching. \"But it will hurt.\" She whined.\n\n*Stop whinging, mortal. You're wasting time.* Guang Qiu interjected.\n\n*Well, excuse me for my hesitation! What a coward I am, not wanting to have my leg broken without anesthesia!*\n\n\"Hurry up,\" the doctor urged, seemingly in concert with the unseen and unheard Guang Qiu. \"I don't have all day!\"\n\nJiaojiao bit back a sarcastic quip about the doctor's busy clinic. It wouldn't do to piss off the man about to break your leg. \n\nFinally, slowly, heart beating a nervous staccato in her chest, Jiaojiao lay back and placed the wooden rod between her lips. The doctor had reappeared with a wooden mallet. She squeezed her eyes shut.\n\nShe felt a firm grip holding down her right leg then, a huge force impacted her leg with a horrific crack, accompanied by a screaming of panicked nerves telling her, *yes indeed, your leg has been broken. Why did you agree to this, you* collassal *idiot?*\n\nJiaojiao squeezed her eyes shut tight, tears trickling into her temples as she bit down hard on the dowel. She twisted, groaning in pain.\n\n\"Hold still,\" the doctor said, voice almost bored. \"I'm setting the bone.\"\n\nJiaojiao felt a great pressure on her leg as the doctor pulled the leg straight. She had thought the worst of the pain was over but she was greatly mistaken. She could not help the unholy shriek that burst from her. The doctor set the bone, reinforcing it with two rods, cousins to the one currently creaking in distress between her jaws. He then bound it with strips of rough hemp cloth, pulling it taut against her leg.\n\nThen the dowel was taken from her lips. Jiaojiao opened her eyes in time to see a round brown object stuffed into her mouth. It was terribly bitter and broke into a mess of powder the moment it hit her tongue. A riot of conflicting flavors, all terrible, invaded her tastebuds. She nearly spat it out, but the doctor glared at her.\n\n\"Swallow it.\"\n\nJiaojiao choked down the herbal powder with difficulty. \"What was that?\"\n\n\"Medicine to heal your leg, or did you think the thirteen taels was the price of breaking a bone?\" The doctor laughed sarcastically. \"Even I'm not that shameless.\"\n\nSo you *are* self aware, Jiaojiao thought, then closed her eyes again, unable to have a meaningful discourse with her leg radiating monstrous pain. \n\n\"Your leg will be strong enough to walk on after a week of healing, but I'd advise against running, jumping or heavy lifting. Try not to exert too much stress on it. Keep off your feet as much as possible,\" a pause, \"not that it matters much. With that poison in you, I doubt you'll live more than a few months.\"\n\n*Great bedside manner, doc. Five stars.*\n\n\"You have half a shichen to recuperate. Then I'm kicking you out.\"\n\nRetreating footsteps, then the sound of a door slamming shut. \n\n*Mortal?*\n\n*Shut up Guang Qiu. The artifact can affort to wait until I'm not a writhing mess of pain.*\n\nThere was a dissatisfied silence, but the ball didn't speak again.\n\nJiaojiao drifted, half insensible with pain, for what seemed like days. It took all her willpower not to scream out and make a fool of herself, but the thought of the doctor's sarcastic smile gave her a dose of strength.  Thankfully, the doctor's medicine was not just a sugar pill, and the soon pain died down to manageable levels. Jiaojiao sat up, wiping the tears from her eyes. It was without question that the layer of powder had been half ruined by her pain-induced weeping. \n\nShe took a look around, but there was no reflective surface she could use to inspect herself. She placed the straw hat on her head again, hoping it would be enough to obscure her features. Gingerly, she lowered her left leg down off the platform, then much more carefully, her right. Jiaojiao leaned heavily on her staff and shuffled toward the door, nearly falling over several times. It was the best Jiaojiao could expect in this era before plaster casts and aluminum crutches.\n\nShe made it past the partition between the front and back sections of the clinic when she heard a deep, magnetic voice.  A terrible premonition came to her, stopping her in her tracks. Unable to bring herself to move forward, she began inching backward. \n\n*What do you think you're doing, mortal? Stop wasting time!*\n\nShit. Shit. Jiaojiao was repeating to herself in an endless litany. I hope that isn't who I think it is.\n\n\"You there! Girl! Are you done taking up space in my clinic?\" The doctor came after her shrinking form. \"If you're able to walk about then it's time for you to pay up and leave.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't happen to have a back entrance in this place, would you?\" Jiaojiao asked.\n\nThe doctor gave her a strange look. \"Yes... why do you ask? Nevermind, just give me the money and get out.\"\n\nJiaojiao slapped the silver taels into his hand and gave him an angry smile. \"Take me out the back.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n*Why are you still here? Just go! We don't have time for this!* Guang Qiu said.\n\nJiaojiao summoned all her dwindling patience. \"*Fine.*\" And began the arduous journey out the front of the clinic, hoping her premonition wasn't accurate. Please don't let it be *that guy.*\n\nHer pleas to the universe went unheeded. A tall figure with fine black embroidered robes stood in the dusty waiting area, a white porcelain mask over his face. He raised his head to look in her direction as she shuffled closer, radiating a cold and ferocious aura.\n\nJiaojiao stopped, frozen in dread. *Why the fuck is it him?* \n\n*Mortal! Mortal!* Guang Qiu said, sounding like Christmas had come early. *Look! It's him! Your future husband!*","lastmodified":"2022-04-29T11:35:13.400702706Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/Chapter11-The-Cold-Prince":{"title":"Untitled Page","content":"*Crap, shit, fuck, piz-detz, hui.*\n\nThe future husband Guang Qiu spoke of was named Mo Wudi, the titular character in *The Cold Prince Loves me Dearly*. Not only was he cold, he was an ice-cold killer. And not only was he an ice-cold killer, he was an ice-cold killer prone to sudden, inexplicably rages, notorious for lashing out at random.\n\nHe had two identities, one as the thirteenth prince of Languo, and the other, more mysterious identity as the masked head of the Abyss Syndicate, an organization that dominated the Jianghu.\n\nMore importantly, in addition to having great influence, Mo Wudi was one of the most physically jacked people in Languo, having crossed the threshold of martial master and stepped on the true threshold of immortal cultivation.\n\nIf Mo Wudi was considered a level 90 player, then Jiaojiao would be one of those harmless atmospheric mobs that would die with a casual poke. It was imperative that she avoid this mercurial psycho as much as possible. \n\n*What are you waiting for?* Guang Qiu said. *Go introduce yourself!*\n\nJiaojiao ignored the ball and shuffled as rapidly as she could with her immobilized right leg. She made a sharp angle toward the counter, intent on giving the living yama a wide berth. The figure turned with her movements, the glaring demon eyes of the mask fixed upon her.\n\n*Yeah, that's not creepy at all.*\n\n*Don't be shy, just go up and talk to him,* Guang Qiu coaxed, as if it were a wingman in a singles bar.\n\nUnfortunately, the clinic was not that spacious, and Jiaojiao was not that lucky. Her balance failed her at the worst juncture and she found herself falling toward that cold figure with almost calculated precision.\n\n*Gav-no!* Jiaojiao defaulted to Russian in her time of crisis.\n\nAs Jiaojiao fell, she had a split second to consider several possibilities. Taking Mo Wudi's personality as depicted in the webnovel, there were two likely outcomes. One, he would simply dodge aside and allow Jiaojiao to humiliate herself as nature intended. Or two, he would be too lazy to move and slap her dead with a contemptuous palm. \n\nHowever, neither of these scenarios came to pass. Instead of face-planting on the clinic floor or stepping onto the naihe bridge, she found herself cradled in an unlikely pair of firm arms. Her straw hat was bumped off her head and her face smushed against a solid chest.\n\nJiaojiao couldn't move, frozen in pure fright. One second, two seconds, then she jerked her face as if the young man was made from scalding hot coals. \n\n*Hashtag wtf?*  What was this shoujo manga development? Where was the crazy, murderous psychopath I was promised?\n\n\"Thank you very much,\" Jiaojiao said robotically as she shuffled back. \"I need to go now goodbye.\"\n\nShe booked it, making for the front entryway as fast as she could with her immobilized leg. Are you kidding? If she didn't leave now when would she? What if Mo Wudi realized he'd broken character and came after her to fix his gaffe?\n\n*Where are you going?* Guang Qiu said. *You didn't even say more than a few words. What a splendid first encounter! He hugged you!*\n\nThe only thing missing from Guang Qiu's speech was a squeal of delight. \n\n*We are leaving. Now.*\n\n*Why are you so eager to leave?*\n\n*Didn't you want to go get the artifact or was that not you whining the entire morning?*\n\n*You can ask him to go with you!*\n\n*Guang Qiu I don't know if I should be amused or disgusted by your naivete. What makes you think he'll agree? We are nothing by passersby.*\n\n\"Wait,\" said a deep magnetic voice.\n\n*He's talking to you!*\n\n*What? I didn't hear anything.* She was almost at the door--\n\n\"Girl, stop.\"\n\n*You must have heard that. Who else could he be talking to? Surely not Doctor Tai,* Guang Qiu said sarcastically.\n\n*Who are we to question Doctor Tai's gender identity?*\n\n\"Didn't you hear the young--, I mean this gentleman?\" Doctor Tai stepped forward to catch Jiaojiao by the sleeve. \"Where do you think you're going in a rush? One would think your leg isn't broken at all!\"\n\n\"What does this gentleman have to do with me? Should I stop to answer every random heckler?\" Jiaojiao smiled. \"Or are you intent on harassing a young lady?\"\n\nThe Doctor sneered. \"Don't put on airs now. You think I didn't see you just now, when you practically threw yourself in this man's arms?\"\n\n\"Are we living in the same reality? I only have one leg right now. Is it so strange that I tripped? The man caught me, I thanked him, and now would like to go on with my day. Who are you people to stop me?\" Jiaojiao jerked her sleeve from Doctor Tai's grasp, thumping her staff for emphasis.\n\n\"Bai Xingyue.\"\n\nJiaojiao froze.\n\nDoctor Tai's eyes widened, as if he was seeing Jiaojiao for the first time. \"No wonder you're half dead with poison.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's me,\" Jiaojiao said through gritted teeth. \"What of it?\"\n\nThe masked man, brushed off a smudge of powder from the front of his robe. \"Your makeup is shedding.\"\n\nShe nearly combusted from embarrassment. If this were her previous life on earth, being caught wearing inferior cosmetics would be a career ending snafu. \"Thank you for alerting me. Is that all?\"\n\n\"I didn't realize we had the future empress in our humble establishment!\" Doctor Tai was sneering. \"Dianxia, thus humble servant sends his greetings!\"\n\n\"Hahahaha,\" Jiaojiao had no more fucks to give and was seriously fed up. She left no parting remark, simply leaving the doctor and the impassive Mo Wudi to whatever conversation they were having before she'd interrupted.\n\nThe rickshaw puller was where she left him, she threw him another few copper coins. \"To Yixin street.\"\n\nJiaojiao had an interesting time dragging her splinted leg into the cart while the rickshaw driver offered no help, simply taking her struggles as scenery. As the rickshaw pulled into traffic, Jiaojiao pulled the straw hat lower on her face, shading it from the noonday sun. \n\n*I still think you should have asked him to go with you.*\n\n*Guang Qiu, why are you so sure he'd like me?* Jiaojiao asked, genuinely curious. *After all, I am not Bai Jing. I have very little in common with him. If I read the story correctly, he liked Bai Jing because she was similar to him. After all, they could bond over the art of murder or some such. What do I have in common with that guy? Huh?*\n\n*It doesn't matter! You can develop with time!*\n\n*Not likely. Do you know how old that guy is? He's seventeen!*\n\n*...and?*\n\n*You think a seventeen year old boy and a twenty-three year old girl are a likely pair?*\n\n*...but your body is only fifteen years old.*\n\n*Is this the point? You think just because the body is fifteen the mind will regress?* Jiaojiao shook her head. It would be like a high school student dating a college graduate. She doubted she could have a single meaningful conversation with a seventeen year old, much less a whole-ass relationship. Highschool boys were closer to apes than people in her view. *Besides, in my world, a seventeen year old getting with a twenty-three year old is considered statutory rape.*\n\n*This isn't your old world,* Guang Qiu argued. *To be unmarried at twenty-three... you would be called a spinster.*\n\nJiaojiao glared at the ball. *Call me that again.*\n\n*Don't get offended, it's true! Besides, isn't this a good opportunity to fix your status?*\n\n*Why do you think being single is something to be fixed? Maybe I'm happy being single.*\n\n*Isn't this what mortals do? Get married, have babies and then die. Besides, you must form a relationship with Mo Wudi. The plot calls for it!*\n\nJiaojiao shook her head. In the events of the webnovel, Bai Jing met and fell in love with Mo Wudi, despite a nine year age difference. Big Yikes. Put even if she could excuse that behavior as being in a gray area due to Bai Jing being in a younger body, their entire relationship dynamic made Jiaojiao uncomfortable to read. Mo Wudi was a deeply troubled young man and Bai Jing happened to fill a void in his life. It was disturbing to note that the teenager was deeply obsessed with the woman after meeting her, even abandoning many aspects of his life to please her. The novel portrayed it as a deep and moving love story, but Jiaojiao wasn't so sure.\n\n*That boy needs therapy, not a relationship. I don't have the energy or ability to fix him.*\n\nGuang Qiu grumbled but didn't push it. Perhaps occupied with the thought of retrieving the artifact. *Perhaps it's for the best you left when you did. You're not supposed to meet him for another few days anyway.*\n\nThe rest of the ride passed in silence. Jiaojiao watched the sights of the city pass by, wrinkling her nose as they passed a marketplace. The babble of servants bargaining with the sellers filled her ears. Rotten vegetable leaves choked the gutters and a tanned woman wrung the neck of a squawking chicken. Jiaojiao looked on, aghast.A gaggle of painted beauties loitered in front brightly decorated storefront, beckoning to passing men. A gust of wind brought the smell of incense and perfume. Enticing smells drifted from the roadside carts, sellers calling out prices, ladling dumplings into wooden bowls.\n\n\"We're here,\" the rickshaw driver paused on the corner of a quiet street. \n\nJiaojiao showed the rickshaw the token she'd found in Cen Wei's sleeve. \"Do you know which shop this is from?\"\n\nThe rickshaw driver simply pointed to a particular shop, a it had gaudily decorated front with red lanterns and gold paint, a contrast to the other more modestly attired shops on the street.\n\n\"Looks like a scam,\" Jiaojiao muttered as she hauled her body off the rickshaw. She slowly made her way through the crowd, careful not to jostle her leg. Thankfully the crowd wasn't too dense and she only suffered a few slight bumps. As she neared the shop entrance, a girl dressed in a bright pink exited the shop, speaking sharply to the two servants flanking her. \n\nJiaojiao nearly twisted into a pretzel turning aside, hurriedly pulling the straw hat down in front of her face.\n\n*Isn't that...*\n\n*Yep.*\n\nBai Xingwu, the violent girl who'd nearly punched into a paste the day before was somehow a patron of very the same shop Cen Wei frequently pawned things to. Who would have thought? Does this ugly shop have some destiny with the Bai Family?\n\n\"Mistress, you have such good taste!\" one of the servants said.\n\n\"This shimmering pearwood bracelet looks so pretty on your wrist! It really makes your skin glow!\"\n\n*No. No way.*\n\n*Mortal!* Guang Qiu wailed in her mind. *That girl has the artifact!*","lastmodified":"2022-04-29T11:35:13.400702706Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/Chapter12-The-Pawnshop":{"title":"Chapter 12-The Pawnshop","content":"\"Wait, young miss,\" a voice came from inside the pawnshop.\n\nJiaojiao found a shadowed alley to her left and made a slow retreat toward it as Bai Xingwu turned to confront the man calling after her.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" she asked haughtily, chin raised to the sky.\n\nA man wearing a festive red shop uniform came into view with a chagrined expression. \"There has been a mistake, that bracelet isn't for sale as the default period has not passed.\"\n\n\"What do you mean? I paid money for it. It's mine now.\"\n\nThe man bowed his head, \"I apologize, but it really isn't for sale.\"\n\n\"Do you know who I am?!\" Bai Xingwu stomped her foot.\n\nJiaojiao nearly laughed. *Next, she'll ask if they know who her father is.*\n\n\"Do you know who my father is?!\"\n\nThis time Jiaojiao had to choke down a chuckle. If that girl heard her who knows what would happen next.\n\n*Is this a laughing matter?* Guang Qiu berated. *The artifact is about to be taken away for good!*\n\n\"Miss, that bracelet came into our shop just yesterday. It is standard policy not to sell anything that hasn't passed a month of waiting time. This is to give the customer time to redeem their property.\"\n\n\"What kind of shop doesn't sell the things on display?\" Bai Xingwu mocked.\n\nThe man's nose was nearly touching his knees with how low he was bowing, face nearly as red as his uniform. \"I don't know why it was on display, but the records indeed show that the bracelet isn't currently for sale. If you would come back inside, we would be happy to provide a seventy percent discount on your next purchase.\"\n\n\"What nonsense! My father will have this place closed down for this insolence! Do you think the Bai Family is some soft persimmon?\"\n\n\"Wait! Wait!\" came a second, shrill voice from the shop as a tall, skinny man with a pointed beard rushed out. \"Ji Xin, you dare make a fool of yourself here?! How could you treat a valued customer like this?!\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"I'm very sorry miss,\" the skinny man similarly bowed to Bai Xingwu. \"Don't mind anything this idiot says, he's merely worker here.\"\n\n\"Hmmph!\" Bai Xingwu turned up her nose. \"See if I dare shop here again! What rudeness! You will be sure my father will be hearing about this!\"\n\n\"No, no, we wouldn't dare slight the Bai family,\" the man panicked, reaching into his sleeve, he presented a red slip of bamboo to Bai Xingwu with both hands. \"Please, take this voucher. Your next purchase will be entirely free!\"\n\nShe sniffed and delicately took the slip with two fingers. \"At least someone in this awful place knows how to conduct themselves.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned to leave, her two servants showing the pair of men the whites of their eyes.\n\n\"Who do they think their are, speaking that way to the young miss?\"\n\n\"Hmmph, it would serve them right if they get shut down. What a bunch of cheats,\" the servant fished a bamboo whistle from her sleeve and blew three sharp notes on it.\n\nA fine carriage with the Bai family standard painted on its side glided into view, drawn by two handsome white steeds. Bai Xingwu stepped inside, assisted by her two servants. With a tap of a horsewhip, the coachman drew away, blowing a cloud of dust onto the two men who had yet to rise from their bow. Jiaojiao couldn't say she was very fond of the young girl, but she had to admit she had *style*.\n\n*It's over,* Guang Qiu lamented. *What do we do now?*\n\n*So dramatic.*\n\n*Mortal, you don't understand how important that artifact is,* Guang Qiu said, with a heretofore absent measure of patience.\n\n*I do. Without it, I doubt Bai Jing could have accomplished even half of what she did in the book. But so what?*\n\n*What do you mean,* so what?\n\n*You seem to be laboring under the impression that the things Bai Jing wanted and the things I want are one and the same,* Jiaojiao gave Guang Qiu a smile. *Would you believe me if I told you I want nothing to do with that bracelet? I would be happy if that thing never appeared in front of me again.*\n\n*I don't believe you,* Guang Qiu sneered. *A mortal's lust for power is endless. You expect me to believe you don't covet eternal youth and beauty? Knowing how vain you are, I'm surprised you haven't gone insane stuck in that body with that ugly face.*\n\nJiaojiao's smile didn't fade. *Guang Qiu, you saw my body when you picked me up, right? Do you admit that it was very beautiful?*\n\n*I don't pay attention to these things.*\n\n*Well, that body is the only one I acknowledge as mine.* Jiaojiao observed a moment of poignant silence. *Anyway, what difference does it make if I'm stuck in a different body? I don't have any connection to the people in this world. How they see this body, I don't care at all.*\n\n*But this is your life!*\n\nJiaojiao gave Guang Qiu a funny look. *My life ended yesterday. This is just... like some bonus round in a video game.*\n\n*A what?*\n\n*A form of entertainment people in my world engaged in as a way to pass time.*\n\n*How dare you? This is far more important than some game!*\n\n*It may be very important to you. But haven't you got the memo? I don't care at all!*\n\nThe ball drew itself up, unable to digest this statement. *Even if you die?*\n\n*It would be a shame to die again, but I wouldn't be too upset. After all, this place doesn't have running water, internet, amazon or any of the comforts of modern life. Oh, but slavery and human rights violations are everywhere! Not to mention dangerous things like beast tides, and yaoguai and what else?* Jiaojiao made a show of holding her chin. *Oh right, the patriarchy! Mustn't forget that women are second class citizens in this place. If I didn't know any better, I'd think I'd gone to hell and this was a scenario cooked up by demons just to torture me.*\n\nGuang Qiu went still, it's light dimming to an alarming level. It floated there, unresponsive no matter how many times Jiaojiao called it. Her eyes sparkled as she reached out and gave it a poke, but her fingers felt nothing as they passed through its smokey form.\n\n*What are you doing?!*\n\n*I thought you'd suffered a critical error,* she sighed in disappointment. *Is it such a blow, knowing I have no motivation to live?*\n\n*How will the plot progress if the heroine doesn't behave herself?* It asked itself sadly. *My perfect record. Gone.*\n\n*Oh, do you have a hard-ass for a boss? I can relate.*\n\n*This isn't about that at all! Do you have any concept of the havoc a derailed fate-line would wreak? Bai Jing was a force for change in this world! Many events will turn out differently without her presence.*\n\n*Who can say if what she did was for the better?* Jiaojiao sneered. *You read the book. She wasn't some good person that spread love and cheer. She started wars, ended thousands of lives.*\n\n*Even your tiny mortal brain should understand that sometimes hard decisions need to be made for the greater good.*\n\n*I can't agree with that at all. I might not be a good person, and I'm not an expert in ancient court politics, but even I know that a war of succession doesn't need to be fought on the battlefield with the lives of the subjects as fodder!*\n\n*Is that why you don't want to get involved with Mo Wudi? Because you don't want to get involved with the war?*\n\n*Um, there are so many many reasons I don't want to get involved with a seventeen year old boy, but yeah, go ahead, list that as one of them.*\n\n*You think he will put down his quest for revenge without your presence? Don't be a fool! He will be worse without a guiding presence by his side! Bai Jing was the one who kept him from turning this empire into a sea of blood and flame!*\n\nJiaojiao shook her head. *Even if that's true, I can't be the so-called guiding presence.*\n\n*Why not?*\n\n*What right does an outsider to this world have to meddle in its conflicts? Wouldn't someone of this world--*\n\n*It has to be you! No one else will do!* Guang Qiu admitted in a burst of passion.\n\n*Why?*\n\n*I... can't tell you that.*\n\n*Why am I not surprised?* Jiaojiao hefted her staff and made for the door of the pawnshop.\n\n*Where are you going now?*\n\n*You'll see.*\n\nJiaojiao leaned heavily on the staff as she entered the shop. The air was richly scented with sandalwood and ambergris. The worker behind the counter looked up as she stumbled and nearly fell, making a show of dragging her bad leg. The worker's eyes lingered on her dusty robe and her rustic straw hat.\n\n\"Hello,\" she said fretfully, holding a sleeve to her eyes. \"My grandmother came here yesterday to pawn a bracelet. I'm here to redeem it.\"\n\nThe worker, the same man who had tried to stop Bai Xingwu from leaving with the bracelet, avoided Jiaojiao's eyes, as if he already knew which bracelet and which grandmother she was speaking of. \"May I see your token?\"\n\nJiaojiao placed Cen Wei's token on the counter. \"It's' a keepsake of my dear mother, but I fell down some stairs and broke my leg yesterday--\" she sniffed, blinking back a a dewy batch of tears, \"--but we didn't have the money! So my grandmother--\"\n\n\"It's been sold.\" The hapless man looked very much like he wanted the ground to open up and eat him. \"I'm very sorry.\"\n\nJiaojiao drew her head back, as if unable to comprehend his words. \"What?\"\n\n\"I'm very sorry, the bracelet has been sold.\"\n\n\"But... shouldn't there be a thirty day waiting period?\"\n\n\"It was our mistake,\" the man bowed his head. \"I will take responsibility and compensate you with another bracelet if you so wish.\"\n\nJiaojiao's tears ran freely down her cheeks. \"But I don't w-want another b-bracelet, I want my mother's bracelet!\"\n\n*How ugly. You think you can charm him with those ugly looks of yours?* Guang Qiu muttered.\n\n\"I'm very very sorry!\" the man said, his young face creased in distress. \"I will compensate you the full price of what we gave that girl today!\"\n\n\"Wait just a minute!\" a shrill voice cut in. \"What do you think you're doing Ji Xin?\"\n\n\"This young miss--\"\n\n\"Why are you wasting time with a peasant? Just drive her out.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Is this how you conduct business?!\" Jiaojiao screeched through her tears, her attitude going from helpless waif to belligerent shrew. \"I demand to know where my bracelet has gone!\"\n\n\"It's been sold!\" the man with the pointy beard pointed at Jiaojiao's face, \"what an ugly girl! You have the face to come out in public and scare people? Just crawl back to the countryside from where you came! Don't dirty people's eyes!\"\n\n\"Hah! You want to drive me out with that?\" Jiaojiao drew her staff up as if gearing up for battle. \"You think I'm ugly? Heh! Your face will be worst after I'm done with you! Just see if I let you do business in this town again! I'll shout from the rooftops how the Ji clan doesn't know how to conduct business! How their pawnshop cheats honest people! See if I don't!\"\n\nThe pointy-bearded man sneered. \"You're just a little girl! What can you do? That bracelet was sold to the Bai family, go take it up with them if you dare!\"\n\n\"Heh! You think the poor are easily bullied? Just wait and see! All I have to do is say two words in the ears of those gossiping servants down at market. You'll be the talk of the town tomorrow!\"\n\n\"You dare--\"\n\nThe young man--Ji Xin, hastily pulled the skinny man aside bending close to whisper in his ear. The two had an angry protracted conversation while Jiaojiao impatiently rapped her staff on the ground.\n\nThe younger man soon came back, his handsome face creased in a smile. \"I'm very sorry for the wait,\" he said, sliding a pouch over the counter.\n\nJiaojiao sniffed and pulled the pouch open. Inside were several silver coins. \"Was that so hard?\"\n\nThe pointy-bearded man looked as if he was ready to murder. Jiaojiao flashed a smile, then simply turned to leave.\n\n*You're a cheat,* Guang Qiu said. *Cen Wei was already paid for the bracelet. How does that man calculate? Their business will be run into the ground sooner or later if they keep this up.*\n\n*You can't put a price on reputation,* Jiaojiao smiled. *Merchants don't have high social class to begin with. If they are accused of corruption, the officials will swoop in and then they'll have nothing. Besides, it's a fact that they broke their own rules.*\n\nJiaojiao relaxed into the rickshaw, allowing her mind to wander. It was taxing on her starved body to drag her dead leg about. She was done with the day hours ago.\n\nIt wasn't until she jolted awake in a dark, deserted alley that she realized something had gone very wrong.\n\n*Wake up, mortal! You're in danger!*\n\n*Guang Qiu, what's happening?* she asked groggily. Her sleepiness was short-lived, however, when she noticed the young rickshaw driver had climbed over the back of the cart and had a dagger pointed at her throat.\n\n*Isn't it obvious?* Guang Qiu sighed. *You're being robbed.*","lastmodified":"2022-04-29T11:35:13.400702706Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/Chapter13-Tu-Wenfeng":{"title":"Chapter 12-Tu Wenfeng","content":"\"Hand over all your money!\" the boy said, pressing the dagger against her neck. His face was stoic, but his voice was young and trembling.\n\nJiaojiao shifted away from the cold steel, but it followed her, close as a shadow. A prick announced that the knife had broken skin. The young rickshaw driver's face, tense and drawn with adrenaline jerked at the sight of blood trickling down her neck.\n\n*What luck. I've conned a sum out of that pawnshop and now it's my turn.*\n\n*There is a thing such as karma,* Guang Qiu said smugly. \n\nIt would be the smart thing to do, to hand over the money, but Jiaojiao was tired of the universe trampling over her. First she'd been downloaded into this ruin of a body, then she'd had to deal with Cen Wei, that sadistic servant feeding her garbage among other things. She'd had her leg broken this morning. She'd nearly had a heart attack being embraced by Mo Wudi, that psycho. She'd been dealing with Guang Qiu's non-stop nagging. \n\n\"I'm done,\" Jiaojiao announced to the world at large. \"If this is where I die, so be it!\"\n\n\"Did you hear me?\" the boy gestured with his free hand, \"give me all your money!\"\n\nJiaojiao's eyes caught on a long jagged scar on his left forearm and fell deep into thought. \n\n*What are you waiting for?* Guang Qiu said nervously. *If you don't give him the money then you really will die.*\n\n*What are the chances that I meet three new characters in the book all in one day?* Jiaojiao asked.\n\nGuang Qiu paused. *I only count two, Mo Wudi and Doctor Tai. Who else?*\n\n*It's three. If I'm not mistaken, this young man is Tu Wenfeng,*\n\n*Ah! He has the same scar! You might be right!* Guang Qiu vibrated with agitation. *But how can this be? Shouldn't he only appear in chapter thirty? We haven't even reached chapter three yet in terms of time passage! This is no good! The chronology is a mess!*\n\n\"Isn't this bullying the infirm?\" Jiaojiao tsked. \"You should be ashamed of yourself. Robbing the sick.\"\n\nThe boy turned red, though his expression didn't change. \"I'm sorry, but I have a very important use for this money.\"\n\n*Say, he's blushing from shame. Why does this seem very different from the Tu Wenfeng in the book? Wasn't this guy supposed to be a merciless thief and killer?*\n\nThis seemed to set Guang Qiu at ease. *Maybe you're mistaken and this isn't Tu Wenfeng after all.*\n\n*I don't know. Perhaps something happened between now and chapter 30 that caused his personality to undergo a change.*\n\n\"Important enough to cast your morals to the wayside?\" Jiaojiao asked the boy. \"You are strong and able-bodied, what is it that's keeping you from earning the money?\"\n\n\"I don't have the time. Please just give me the money, I don't want to hurt you.\"\n\n\"Every thief in the world thinks they have a better use for the money they steal than those they're stealing from,\" Jiaojiao shook her head. \"You think you're desperate enough to kill, then go ahead.\"\n\n*Mortal, are you stupid? Why are you provoking him?*\n\n*Relax, if he had the guts to kill me for this bit of change, then he would have slit my throat instead of trying to negotiate. Honestly, who says \"please\" to the people they're robbing?*\n\nHaving decided that he'd waited long enough, Tu Wenfeng's feet shifted as he stepped in closer, reaching toward Jiaojiao's sleeve where she kept the coin pouch. \"Don't resist, I know your leg is injured.\"\n\nJiaojiao suddenly jerked up the staff resting on her knees and knocked his knife away.\n\n\"Ah!\" the boy cursed and bent down to scrabble for the knife on the dirty alley floor.\n\nJiaojiao didn't budge from her seat, because really, how far would she get with her leg? She rest her chin in her hand as she lounged against the side of the rickshaw, watching the boy spring up with the retrieved dagger.\n\n\"Why don't you tell me more about what you need the money for? Maybe if you move me with your sincerity, I'll give it to you.\"\n\nThe boy hesitated, fingering the dagger with shaking hands. \"What if you decide you don't want to give the money?\"\n\n\"Then we can fight it out! Cripple to rickshaw driver!\" she tapped her bad leg. \"What are you worried about? It's not like I can run away.\"\n\nThe boy bowed his head. \"There's a girl...\"\n\n*Jesus, spare me. Why is it always a girl?* Jiaojiao clicked her tongue. \"And what? You hope to gather enough riches to impress her and you can go riding into the sunset together and live happily ever after?\"\n\nThe boy turned a vivid, bruised, red. \"It's not like that!\"\n\n\"What? Just because you have a girl you like, you can rob whoever you like?\"\n\n\"If I don't gather enough money to redeem her, she will become a brothel worker. She comes of age in a month. I don't have the time to be earning coppers when buying her would cost fifty silver taels.\" The boy turned a frustrated look the rickshaw. \n\n*Uhhh... was this part of his backstory?* Jiaojiao asked Guang Qiu. *This is why he became an amoral mercenary? He lost his little lover to a brothel? Why wasn't this in the book?*\n\n*I'm not sure. The book can't include every little thing that happens to every character or the author would never rest!*\n\n*I suppose you have a point. Speaking of which, why is a webnovel written by some middle schooler dictating the events in your world anyway?*\n\n*Hehe, trying to get more information from me?* Guang Qiu mocked. *Keep dreaming, mortal.*\n\n\"I don't have fifty taels on me,\" Jiaojiao confessed. \"Even if you rob me, you'll have to go on to rob others, unless of course you happen to have the difference on you?\"\n\nThe boy looked on eyes wide, as Jiaojiao shook out her sleeves into her lap and began counting change. \"I have fifteen taels, how much do you have?\"\n\n\"I--I--\"\n\nJiaojiao clapped her hands, eyes sparkling. \"That gives me an idea! I have a business proposition for you.\"\n\n\"W-what?\"\n\n\"Listen, I'm not exactly rich either, but I have ways to make money. Unfortunately, I can't do much with my body the way it is. I need someone who can act for me. I can supply the ideas while you do the rough work. Deal?\"\n\n\"What sort of ideas?\" the boy asked, interest piqued.\n\n*What do you think you're doing?!* Guang Qiu roared. *What nonsense! Just give him the money and leave! You shouldn't even be talking to him!*\n\n*Oh, spare me. What do you think will happen when he finishes robbing me? You think he would be kind enough to drop me off at the Bai Estate?*\n\nGuang Qiu choked.\n\n*Exactly, I'll be stranded in this alley with no money and no way to get home! I might as well toss all my chips in and hope for the best!*\n\n*He seems like an agreeable young man, perhaps if you ask nicely--*\n\n*No way! I already owe Hu Maoxun, like, ten taels of silver!* Jiaojiao shot Guang Qiu a sharp look. *Haven't you heard that debt is the slavery of the free? I absolutely can't abide being in debt. You know what my biggest problem is?*\n\n*That you've lost the artifact?*\n\n*Idiot! It's money! So what if Bai Xingwu has the artifact, right? \n\n*Right?*\n\n*So, how do I get it back from her? Because realistically, do you think this body, with my soul, is capable of sneaking into her courtyard and past all the guards and whatever servants she has?*\n\n*You... you...* Guang Qiu dimmed. *What then?*\n\n*If I had money, I could just hire someone to steal it back from her!*\n\n*Hah! Good luck! With the Bai Family's reputation, you think anyone would be willing to cross them for some pocket change?*\n\n*You're thinking too simply. The Bai family is powerful, but that just means they have powerful enemies. Besides, you think the people in the Jianghu care about things like social status? Wasn't Bai Jing able to find a lot of helpers there who didn't give a crap about the Bai family?*\n\nGuang Qiu chewed on this for a minute. *I suppose you have a point.*\n\n\"Hello? Miss? Are you alright? What are you looking at?\" Tu Wenfeng asked, peering at the empty air where Guang Qiu floated.\n\n\"Nothing, I'm just thinking,\" Jiaojiao said. \"As for ideas, I can name a few. Are there many tanneries in the capital?\"\n\n\"Yes, there's at least ten,\" Tu Wenfeng answered. \"Why?\"\n\n\"You'll see,\" Jiaojiao smiled.\n\nTu Wenfeng stared at her skeptically, his grasp on the dagger tightening ominously.\n\n*Looks like you couldn't convince him,* Guang Qiu sighed.\n\n\"If you don't believe me, take me to a place you can keep me secured. It's not like it would be hard to keep me from running away. Like your house,\" Jiaojiao paused. \"You do have a house, don't you?\"\n\n\"M-my house? You want to go to my house?\" the boy drew back as he were a child at a park and Jiaojiao was some creepy weirdo with an iconic white van.\n\n\"What's the matter?\"\n\n\"Y-you're a young girl, shouldn't you be more mindful of propriety?\" the boy looked away, cheeks flaming.\n\n\"What, are you saying I can't trust you, or that you can't trust me?\" Jiaojiao gave Tu Wenfeng a mocking stare. \"What are you worried about? That this cripple will take advantage of you?\"\n\nLooking as if he thought he was doing something very stupid, the boy hesitantly sheathed his dagger and took up the two posts at the front of the rickshaw. He glanced back a Jiaojiao a few times before shaking his head and taking off in a brisk jog.\n\n*You've done it. You've managed to con him. This makes your second victim of the day,* Guang Qiu said, half-stunned, half-reproachful. \n\n*Why do you think it's a con? I'm very serious about this. I never joke about money,* Jiaojiao leaned back in the rickshaw shifting her numb ass. \n\n*What can you possibly do to earn money?* Guang Qiu asked with a skeptical hum. *You think starting a business is easy? I'm not an expert at the affairs of mortals but even I know that this is far from a simple endeavor--* a pause *--or are you simply out to run another scam? Even scams aren't easy to pull off--\n\n*Would you quit calling me a scammer?*\n\nThe two bickered to pass the time. The rickshaw passed over a wide bridge with three lanes of traffic, two for carts and one for pedestrians. A uniformed guard dressed in layered leather armor and a dark blue uniform gestured back and forth, directing traffic and scolding those that veered out of their lane. Jiaojiao held her nose at the foul smell as they passed over the water. With no modern sanitation and hygeine, the river flowing through the city was an awful green. \n\nThere was a change in scenery on the opposite side of the canal. Soon Jiaojiao noticed their surroundings were becoming ever more dull and depressed. Run-down shanties and collapsed wooden structures lined the streets. A beggar crouched by the side of the road, his leg oozing with pus and sores. He held a wooden bowl out to Jiaojiao as the rickshaw passed, but Tu Wenfeng sped up and the beggar was left in the dust. Skinny children sat in doorways, or ran naked in the streets, women with tired faces crouched over basins of cloudy water, washing garments by hand.\n\nTu Wenfeng didn't pause to let Jiaojiao take in the sights, seeming to speed up more and more the nearer he got to his destination. At last, they slowed and came to a stop outside a dingy compound that looked like a wooden cousin to Bai Xingyue's courtyard. A gaggle of dirty-faced children burst out of the entryway and crowded around Tu Wenfeng. Seemingly a thousand young voices called out at once, asking who is this girl?\n\nTu Wenfeng turn toward Jiaojiao, two children hanging from his neck. \"We're here.\"","lastmodified":"2022-04-29T11:35:13.400702706Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/Chapter14-The-Slum-Temple":{"title":"Chapter 14-The Slum Temple","content":"Jiaojiao shrunk back as the children crowded around the creaky rickshaw. Their hands reaching for her staff, her robes, her face, and poked curiously at her splinted leg.\n\nTu Wenfeng straightened,  back rigid as he the children gazed up at him with laughing faces. \"Tutu! You're back! Did you bring anything good to eat?\"\n\n\"Alright, get away!\" Tu Wenfeng barked, pulling the rickshaw into the entryway, not at all minding the three or four toddlers clinging to his legs and back. \"Get out of the way! What if the rickshaw runs you over?\"\n\nApparently this possibility only caused the children greater amusement, as even more jumped on Tu Wenfeng's back and one even crawled into the rickshaw with Jiaojiao, squeezing next to her broken leg until the newly set bone creaked ominously.\n\nIf Mo Wudi had nearly given her a heart attack, then these children were close to giving her an aneurism.\n\n\"Get out of the cart Min Tong, you stupid ghost!\" Tu Wenfeng scolded without venom. \"Can't you see she's injured?\"\n\nMin Tong, a monkey-faced pipsqueak shot gave Jiaojiao a pout, but obediently jumped out of the rickshaw.\n\nTu Wenfeng parked the cart next to a crumbling wall, then turned awkwardly to Jiaojiao, who was hesitant to descend the cart into perilous goblin territory. She watched as the children milled about the rickshaw, speaking over one another to be heard.\n\n\"Who is she?\"\n\n\"Tutu, what about Yanyan? Are you treading on two boats?\"\n\n\"How could you forget Yanyan for this ghost face?\"\n\n\"What's that mark on her face?\"\n\nJiaojiao almost felt self-conscious. Children after all, had no filter. Even if she told herself she didn't have any reason to feel ashamed of her appearance, she still felt a stab of annoyance. She turned to that bratty voice and smiled. \n\n\"What's your name? Min Tong?\"\n\nThe little boy thrust out his chin. \"Yeah, that's me.\"\n\n\"This red mark on my face is a sign of a curse,\" Jiaojiao said with a bitter sigh. \"A goddess saw that I was more beautiful than her, so she cursed me to look--\" she took her sleeve and rubbed away the rest of the powder, revealing the ugly mark in all it's mottled veiny glory \"--like this!\"\n\nMin Tong gaped at Jiaojiao's face for a whole second, then screamed as if he was being lit on fire. \"Monster! It's a guai! Guai!\" \n\nA wet stain appeared between his legs as he ran away as quickly as his stubby two legs could carry him, screaming all the while.\n\nLike a devastating chemical reaction, two more children took one look at Jiaojiao's face, then began to scream, similar wet puddles appearing at their feet. Three, then seven more children ran away, fleeing from the scene of carnage.\n\nTu Wenfeng stared at Jiaojiao's uncovered face, then the gaggle of distressed children on the far side of the courtyard.\n\n\"What? They were noisy.\"\n\n\"You didn't have to frighten them into pissing themselves.\"\n\n\"What is this place?\"\n\n\"It's a temple for the Goddess Nuwa,\" he gave Jiaojiao a pointed look. \"You shouldn't speak so freely about gods in this place, they may hear you.\"\n\nJiaojiao bit back a sarcastic remark, remembering once again she was in a place of gods and demons. \"Not going to comment on this?\" Jiaojiao she said insteadn, pointing at the mark on her face. \n\n\"It's none of my business.\"\n\n\"I commend your conduct,\" Jiaojiao applauded. \"It's fine, I'll tell anyway.  Anyway, so the goddess--\"\n\n*What nonsense are you spouting?* Guang Qiu interrupted. *Are you calling Head Wife Zhang a goddess?*\n\n\"She said that as long as I earn a hundred gold ingots and donate them in her name, then the curse will be lifted.\"\n\n*Why would a goddess care about mortal wealth? What utter--* \n\n\"What is your plan to earn money?\" Tu Wenfeng said. \"I've brought you to my home. You hold up your end of the deal.\"\n\nJiaojiao put down her hands. \"Fine.\"\n\nTu Wenfeng looked away as Jiaojiao struggled down from the cart, only turning back to here when she made an impatient noise. She thumped her staff and gestured. \"Aren't you going to invite me to sit down? You expect to have a conversation while standing around? Might I remind you my leg is injured. \"\n\nThe teenager looked like he was approaching the end of his patience, but led the way into a run-down wooden house with floorboards creaking with each step. \n\nThe children had gotten over their upset and drew closer to them , peering around the edge of the doorway as Tu Wenfeng invited Jiaojiao a seat at the low table and a ratty floor cushion.\n\nJiaojiao had never missed modern furniture more than this moment as she awkwardly lowered herself to sit on the floor, leg pointed outward like a fallen tree.\n\n\"I mentioned some money making ideas, but they are all dependent on your cooperation. I can't do much by myself. Furthermore, much of it requires man power.\"\n\n\"I'm strong.\"\n\n\"Not the power I meant. I mean many able hands, they don't necessarily need to be as strong as you,\" Jiaojiao glanced at the children, who fled screaming at the sight of her face. \"I suppose children would do just fine. Unless there's child labor laws I don't know about?\"\n\n\"Child labor what?\"\n\nJiaojiao threw up a hand. \"I supposed I was worried for no reason.\"\n\n\"Anyhow,\" Jiaojiao placed the pouch on the scarred table. \"I suppose you've been operating in good faith by bringing me here, you can keep a hold of the money.\" \n\nThe pouch disappeared beyond Tu Wenfeng's lapels. \n\n*You are too optimistic,* Guang Qiu sneered. *What makes you think he'll listen to anything you say? What if spends the money randomly?*\n\n*With his girlfriend's life on the line? Unlikely. If I didn't give him the money, he would have taken it sooner or later. The only reason he brought me here is because he's hesitant to kill me. He most likely doesn't have high hopes for whatever I have to say, but he's desperate enough to try.*\n\n\"Do you have any paper?\" Jiaojiao said outloud.\n\nTu Wenfeng took a sardonic glance around the room. \"Does it look like we can afford something so expensive.\"\n\n*Yikes, Iooks like paper is out of play.* \"Fine, can you at least get me some bamboo slips and ink?\"\n\n\"Bamboo is easy, but ink is more difficult.\"\n\n\"Well, you can't expect me to write in the mud with a stick, can you?\" Jiaojiao said.\n\nTwo minutes later, they were sitting in the entryway, Jiaojiao with a stick confiscated from a child squeezed in her hand.\n\nIrritably, she began to scratch out hesitant characters in the dirt.\n\n*Why is your writing so ugly?*\n\n*Well, if your writing looks any better using a stick, then I applaud you. Besides, you should be thankful I know traditional Chinese at all. In my world, most people use simplified.*\n\nSlowly a list of jagged characters appeared on the ground. \n\nMaterials to get:\n- tannery scraps, leather doesn't need to be large, but shouldn't have defects if you can help it\n- twine; ~~silk~~, hemp or cotton. ~~(is silk too expensive? It probably is nevermind.)~~\n- river stones: should be smooth, with interesting colors or patterns are preferred but not absolutely necessary\n- paper: it doesn't need to be very good quality, just enough to write clearly on.\n\nTu Wenfeng scowled down at it. \"What is this gibberish?\"\n\n\"This is phase one,\" Jiaojiao said mysteriously. \"Of course, all of this is dependent on whether we can source materials. Am I to understand there is a mercenary guild in this town?\"\n\n\"What does that have to do with anything? We can't afford to hire anyone.\"\n\n\"We aren't hiring to them, we're selling!\"\n\n\"What could we possibly have that would be--\"\n\n\"Okay enough questions!\" Jiaojiao clapped her hands together briskly. \"I've upheld my end of the deal. You have the money. It's your move.\"\n\nTu Wenfeng stared at her, and she could tell he was very close to just driving her out, sans money, morals be damned.\n\n\"Don't you want to save your Yanyan? You think that beggar's pittance will be enough to buy her?\"\n\nTu Wenfeng closed his eyes and sighed. \"Very well, I hope you aren't lying to me or simply a fool.\"\n\nJiaojiao gave him a set of detailed instructions, then slouched over the low table. *This day has been far too long.*\n\n*It's only the afternoon.*\n\n*Don't remind me.*\n\nAn old woman, squinting in the dim light, tottered into the room under a basket of dirty linens. \"Tutu? What is happening?\" she blinked myopically at Jiaojiao. \"We have a visitor?\"\n\n\"This is...\" he glanced to Jiaojiao, \"I didn't catch your name.\"\n\n\"You can call me Jiaojiao.\"\n\nHe made the introductions briefly, explained to the half-deaf old woman, named Chu Hua, in a loud voice that Jiaojiao would be staying with them for a few days. \n\nChu Hua sighed and waved a hand in exasperation. \"Everyday he brings home another stray.\"\n\nTu Wenfeng left shortly after to finish the day's work and perhaps find some of what Jiaojiao had instructed. The old woman went out the door, bent in half under the weight of her basket. Children streamed after her, asking questions.\n\n\"Did you talk with the guai, Granny Hua?\"\n\n\"Did you see it's face?\"\n\n\"Is it here to eat us?\"\n\n\"Granny, let me help!\"\n\n\"Aiya!\" Chu Hua cried out, seeing all the children with wet trousers and soiled robes. \"Haven't I told you not to wait to go to the outhouse?\"\n\n\"It wasn't our fault!\" Min Tong stood out front, all three feet of him trembling as he pointed at Jiaojiao. \"It was that monster over there!\"\n\nJiaojiao turned a deaf ear as the children heaped a layer of accusations on her, though she spared a guilty glance over all the extra washing that would no doubt fall on that overworked granny.\n\n*What do you hope to achieve in this run-down place? Besides traumatizing children?* Guang Qiu asked gloomily. *This is a waste of time.*\n\n*It isn't a waste,* Jiaojiao's eyes shone. *This is an opportunity! Besides, this place isn't much worse than Bai Xingyue's courtyard. What does it matter if I'm suffering here or I'm suffering there? Not to mention, doesn't Bai Xingwu like to visit every so often to torment Bai Xingyue? Isn't it wise to stay away from that pink calamity until my leg isn't quite so brittle?* \n\nThe granny shote Jiaojiao a confused look, then towed the crowd of children away like a flagship. Jiaojiao enjoyed the afternoon sunlight streaming though the open doorway, not even blinking an eye at the straggling children who stayed to goggle at her or whisper about her supposed demonic attributes.\n\n*You aren't at all uncomfortable being seen as a monster by these children?*\n\n*Why should I worry about what a bunch of crotch goblins think? Besides, most of them have their own problems.* Jiaojiao gestured at a young boy missing his left arm, arguing with that pissant, Min Tong as he dug a hole in the soft dirt of the courtyard with a stick. *For example, I'm at least better off than him. I have all my limbs. Or that girl over there. Does't she have a hare-lip? If they can play happily together with her, it won't be long until they accept me. Right?*\n\nThe granny came back with an empty basket, the children peeling away from her when she entered the house, hesitant to come closer to the ghost-faced girl. \"The children seem to like you.\"\n\n\"Is that what this is?\"\n\n\"If they didn't like you, they would be throwing mud,\" she laughed wearily. \"Many donations have flown away due to their behavior.\" She didn't seem angry at this occurrence.\n\n\"What happened to this temple?\" Jiaojiao asked.\n\nShe sighed, eyes cloudy as she gazed at the timeworn surroundings. \"It's fallen on hard times and isn't as popular as it once was after they built a newer one in a cleaner part of the capital. No one comes here anymore unless it's to get rid of a burden. It's become a place for abandoned children. Whether it's because their family is too poor, or they have other things that aren't acceptable, they end up here.\"\n\n\"Do they become monks?\"\n\nThe granny nodded. \"Some of them. A monk visits every year. If a suitable child is found, they move to another temple in the mountains. However, not many get picked. Even the gods don't want the ones that end up here.\"\n\nJiaojiao smiled mirthlessly. *It seems the more things are different, the more they are the same.*\n\n*What does that mean?*\n\n*Nevermind. Just thought of something sad from the past. It all started when I was a young child, there was a--* Jiaojiao trailed off, eyes misty with unshed tears.\n\n*There was a what?* Guang Qiu asked.\n\nJiaojiao shot Guang Qiu a provocative look. *Why, you curious?*\n\n*What? Why would I care about your past--*\n\n*Oh. Then I won't tell you.*\n\nGuang Qiu buzzed, choked into silence. \"You--\"\n\nChu Hua woman gazed blearily at the same spot where Guang Qiu hung in the air. \"Is there something on the wall? My old eyes aren't very good. If there's a cockroach, don't mind it. As long as you wipe your mouth after you eat, they should leave you alone.\"\n\nJiaojiao turned a set of wide eyes on Chu Hua. \"You have cockroaches?\"\n\n\"They usually only come out at night, but if it rains you will see more,\" she said conversationally. \"Did you not have them where you used to live?\"\n\n*Guang Qiu, we are leaving right away!*\n\n*Hehe, aren't you exactly where you wanted to be? What's the use of crying to me now?* \n\n*What do you understand? Cockroaches! I've never even seen on in real life before!*\n\n*Why are you so disturbed? They aren't so different from every other bug.*\n\n*Not so different? I beg to fucking differ!*\n\nChu Hua turned a concerned eye at the frozen Jiaojiao, whose face was going through several expressions in rapid succession as she stared at nothing.\n\n\"Tutu always finds the oddest ones.\"","lastmodified":"2022-04-29T11:35:13.400702706Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/Chapter15-Rui-Si":{"title":"Chapter 15-Rui Si","content":"Jiaojiao spend a few hours alternating between bickering with Guang Qiu and staring into the middle distance, itching for a phone or some form of internet connection. She had little time to slow down and contemplate her current situation since landing in the world of a webnovel and she hadn't gone this long without social media since the advent of facelog. Her fingers twitched, longing for an absent touchscreen.\n\n*I wonder what my fans are doing,* she thought, mostly to herself. *How long has it been since I died?*\n\n*Time flows differently between worlds. Only a day and a half might have passed here, but it might already be months or years later on that side. Who knows, they may have already forgotten you existed. Everyone you ever knew might already be dead.* \n\nJiaojiao gave the ball an unimpressed look. *Oh, look, you've made me sad.*\n\n*Does nothing affect you at all?*\n\n*Would it please you if I were in emotional distress?* Jiaojiao tsked. *You and Cen Wei are birds of a feather.*\n\n*Don't lump me in with that mortal!*\n\n*Why this disdain for mortals, anyway? Is it so amazing, being an immortal?*\n\n*Of course,* Guang Qiu floated overhead, light pulsing in smug waves. *Isn't it natural for the long-lived to be above those with ephemeral lifespans? Aren't humans the same with dogs and other lesser creatures? Though in my eyes, mortals are little different from a random cat or dog.*\n\n*Oh spare me. For all your superiority aren't you still stuck here, babysitting one such mortal? Aren't you also relying on this mortal for your mission to go well?*\n\nGuang Qiu choked on nothing. *I am not babysitting! My work is very important!*\n\n*What? Are you implying that watching children isn't a worthy task? Do you have something against baby sitters?*\n\n*I--that--it's women's work!*\n\n*That's an interesting rebuttal, given that you've no body. Aren't you a sexless creature? Even asexual beings subscribe to the notion that  women and the work they do are lesser somehow?*\n\nGuang Qiu paused. Jiaojiao waited for it to recover, as it was apt to fall into furious contemplation whenever it faltered during an argument. However, five, then ten minutes passed with no reaction from it.\n\n*Guang Qiu?*\n\n*What?*\n\n*Are you sexist?*\n\n*Of course not! You mortals are all equally lowly! What do I care if they are man or woman?*\n\n*Then why did you say that baby sitting was a women's work and therefore unworthy for the likes of you?*\n\nThe being choked again, falling silent like a piece of code tripping in the same place.\n\n*Interesting.*\n\nA clattering came from the door of the house as three children warily edged into the room, each carrying a bowl. \n\n\"Granny Hua said to give this to you,\" said a girl with a cloth tied over the lower half of her face. She placed down a chipped bowl filled with watery millet gruel.\n\nThe boy next to her threw down his own chipped bowl, this one filled with some greens, then ran out without a word. The second boy followed suit, almost missing the table entirely. The third bowl had a single beige mantou within, clinking stalely against he porcelain. Just looking at it caused Jiaojiao's teeth to hurt.\n\nJiaojiao looked at the offerings in silence. Should she be thankful that at least, it wasn't poisoned?\n\nThe little girl with the face covering blinked long lashes at Jiaojiao, staring at her mark. \n\n\"You have something to say?\"\n\n\"I don't think you're a guai!\" the little girl blurted out.\n\nJiaojiao leaned the table and smiled. \"You're not scared of me? Or maybe you have something even scarier underneath that veil.\"\n\nThe little girl flinched, hands coming up to clutch at her face cloth. \n\n\"Why are you so scared? From one ugly girl to another, you think I would laugh at you?\"\n\n\"It's not... I...\"\n\n\"Let me tell you a secret. If you act like you are very ashamed of your face, then people will look down on you, but if you act as if you don't care, then they will respect you. Isn't this very funny? The more you care about something, the more people will find reasons to hurt you for it. Besides,\" Jiaojiao smiled. \"Isn't it very fun not to care at all what people think? If they have a problem with how you look, then just drive them away.\"\n\nThe girl gave a wry look at the empty surroundings, the two boys having long excused themselves.\n\n\"It's not that bad, being alone,\" Jiaojiao said, poking at the mantou with a thin finger. \"It's hard at first, but you get used to it. And sometimes, once in a long while, you might find people who like you even though you're not perfect. Sometimes, they're the ones that find you.\"\n\n\"Is it true, what you said about being cursed by a goddess?\" the little girl asked. \"Were you very beautiful once?\"\n\n\"I was beautiful once,\" Jiaojiao agreed. \"Do you believe me if I say I can be beautiful again?\"\n\n\"She's lying! Don't listen to her! She's a guai!\" A voice said from the doorway.\n\n\"Min Tong, you should leave before you get scared and pee yourself again.\"\n\nMin Tong glowered. \"Don't listen to her Rui Si, she's just tempting you so she can eat your spirit energy.\"\n\n*What nonsense,* Guang Qiu said.\n\n*Indeed. What part of me looks like it would eat children?*\n\n*That girl doesn't even have spirit energy to devour!*\n\n\"What on earth?\" Jiaojiao laughed. \"I would never eat children. How unsanitary! But--and it this is a *big* but, if I *were* to eat children, why would I pick a scrawny thing like her?\" she pointed at the three foot, twenty-five pound, Rui Si. \"Wouldn't it be smarter to gnaw on something with more meat on their bones? Something with soft, fleshy, cheeks.\" her finger drifted to the white-faced Min Tong.\n\nRui Si laughter chiming laughter rang out as Min Tong scampered away, holding his face as if Jiaojiao were liable to jump up and take a bite out of them.\n\n\"How did he get so fat eating this garbage?\" Jiaojiao poked at the mantou again. It wobbled in the black pottery bowl, clinking against the sides very much like a rock. She picked it up and rapped it on the table.\n\n\"You can soften it by putting it in the millet porridge,\" Rui Si explained. \"Min Tong has good bones. Granny Hua says if he eats well, he be picked by the temple to become a monk.\"\n\n\"Oh? So she feeds him more than the other children?\"\n\n\"If he becomes a virtuous monk, karma will follow. All those that helped him will benefit,\" Rui Si said, as if she were reciting something she heard often enough to callous her ears.\n\nJiaojiao rolled her eyes. \"What garbage!\"\n\n\"Granny--\"\n\n\"I think Granny--\" Jiaojiao bit off the rest of that sentence. \"I think she doesn't know what she's talking about.\"\n\n\"Who are you to talk that way about Granny Hua?\" said a voice from behind.\n\nJiaojiao jumped. Well, she tried to, but only nearly toppled over. She turned a glare on the frowning Tu Wenfeng. \n\n*When did he get back?*\n\n*Only in time to hear you badmouth the old woman.*\n\n\"I just don't think feeding some children and starving others is a good practice,\" Jiaojiao said. \"Or is this something you agreed to?\"\n\nTu Wenfeng's frown grew deeper. \"It's none of your business.\"\n\n\"Sure, whatever,\" Jiaojiao shook her head. \"Did you bring what I asked?\"\n\nTu Wenfeng turned to pick up a bamboo basket, then upended it over the table. Rui Si snatched up two bowls to save them from being overturned, but the mantou was cast aside by Tu Wenfeng's movements.\n\n\"This is all I could find.\"\n\nJiaojiao scrunched up her face in difficulty. The smell wasn't as bad as it could have been, considering the ancients employed the use of urine and animal dung to tan leather, but it wasn't great either. \n\nThere was a variety of scraps, about half of them were useless, but Jiaojiao nodded instead. This she could work with. She began to sort through the mess, throwing aside the useless pieces and choosing the choice bits. Soon she had a sizeable pile of materials.\n\nShe waved a hand at Tu Wenfeng. \"You can take the rest away.\"\n\nHe clenched his jaw, but did as she asked, packing away the discarded scraps to be dumped. \"What will you do now?\"\n\nShe held out her hand.\n\n\"What now?\"\n\n\"Scissors! Or did you expect me to bite the leather in half with my teeth? Did you listen to my directions at all?\"\n\n\"...Granny Hua has a pair. I will ask her for them.\"\n\nJiaojiao began the difficult task of providing sustenance to her body, spooning the millet porridge into her unwilling mouth with wooden spoon.\n\nRui Si, sat by her side, playing with the remaining leather scraps on the table. Jiaojiao could only lament on her behalf the absence of video games. And analog games. Games of any kind really. What did children or anyone do for entertainment in this godsforsaken world anyway?\n\nWas it really all brothels and poetry readings? The endless days without technology and social media seemed to stretch out before her in a vast wasteland. How did people communicate? Did they just... talk face to face?\n\nTu Wenfeng returned with an old pair of rudimentary scissors. Just two pieces of metal bent into the correct shape and sharpened. They lacked any sort of ergonomic handle but Granny Hua must have had them sharpened recently because the leather gave way easily.\n\nJiaojiao abandoned the rest of her food, some soggy, tasteless, over-boiled vegetables she didn't know the names of. Under her deft hands, the leather became uniform strips of varying lengths and thickness. \n\nTu Wenfeng watched on with a scowl, arms folded. \"What is the point of all this?\"\n\nJiaojiao threw aside the scissors. \"Say, do you have some kind of mental problem?\"\n\nThe teenager glared. \"What?\"\n\n\"First, you tried to rob me--\"\n\nRui Si gasped.\n\n\"And when I ask you to cooperate in a business deal, this is how you speak me? Do I owe you anything?\"\n\nTu Wenfeng turned very red.\n\n\"So I will ask again, do you have a mental problem?\"\n\n\"Sorry,\" the boy said, head bowed. \"I am just very anxious. If I don't get the money--\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, yes, your precious Yanyan will become a prostitute. Very sad. Here, hold this end,\" she told Rui Si. Jiaojiao shook her head and started to knot and braid several leather strips. \"But this rudeness? Uncalled for. And I have no patience for it.\"\n\n\"I--\"\n\n\"Either shut up or go away.\"\n\nThe teenager fell silent, standing there like a rotten post. Smelly and unneeded.\n\n\"It looks so pretty!\" Rui Si said. \"Did Tutu really try to rob you?\"\n\n\"Yup, he put a dagger to my neck and everything,\" Jiaojiao craned her head to show Rui Si the raw line that hadn't quite finished scabbing over.  \"What?\" She said when Tu Wenfeng made an awkward expression halfway between rage and embarrassment. \"You dare to do it, and expect people not to talk about it? Idiot.\"\n\nTu Wenfeng finally couldn't bear it and stomped away, leaving the two girls to their devices. Children crowded around the doorway to get a look at what they were doing, but none dared to come closer.\n\nIt was two hours later, when the sunlight was no longer enough to work by, that Jiaojiao stopped work for the day. A pile of braided leather strips lay on the table between her and Rui Si, who had learned how to replicate the five strand braid quickly halfway through.\n\n\"That was very fun!\" Rui Si said. \"What is it for?\"\n\nJiaojiao took a strand and looped it around her wrist, pushing the globe knot through the loop on the other end. A handsome bracelet lay against her thin wrist. She tsked. \"Not quite my style, but it'll hopefully appeal to someone in this era.\"\n\n\"It looks very good!\" Rui Si said. \"Can I have one?\"\n\nJiaojiao simply knotted one around her tiny wrist, looping it twice so it would fit. Rui Si gazed down at the leather cord, eyes sparkling. \n\n\"When are we eating?\" Jiaojiao yawned, massaging a crick in her neck. \"I'm getting hungry.\"\n\nRui Si shot her a strange look. \"But we already had *sun*?\" \n\nJiaojiao gawked. \"Are you saying, you only eat two meals a day?\"\n\nRui Si nodded, still puzzled. \"Why? How many times do you eat?\"\n\nJiaojiao didn't know how to answer. If she was still living her best life, back on modern day earth, she would ideally have five small meals a day, for the best metabolic performance. It seemed Bai Xingyue and the Bai estate had three meals, being nobles who could afford it. But children in the slums...\n\n\"The same as you,\" Jiaojiao said finally.\n\n\"If you are hungry, you can drink water,\" Rui Si said.\n\n*Actually, your the body burns calories to process water so drinking more will only make you hungrier,* Jiaojiao thought.\n\n*Hehe, you now know your wrongs?* Guang Qiu sneered. *If you were in the Bai Estate--*\n\n*I would be sitting down to a poisoned meal with Cen Wei. Would you please shut up about that?*\n\nGuang Qiu fell back into a sullen silence.\n\n*What do you think happened to her?* Jiaojiao asked. *I left her tied up in the courtyard.*\n\nGuang Qiu paused. *That stuttering woman would let her go? Wouldn't she?*\n\nThe two shared a moment of silence for Cen Wei, who probably woke up cold, confused, and concussed, not to mention trussed up like a pig in the middle of the courtyard where any random servant might walk by and see her.\n\nLater, as they lay down on straw mats to sleep, the other children on the far side of the room, Jiaojiao spent a restless hour tossing and turning, paranoid about cockroaches crawling into her mouth. Finally, she pulled the face mask she'd sewn the night before and pulled it over her face before falling into a fitful sleep full of troubled dreams.","lastmodified":"2022-04-29T11:35:13.400702706Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/Chapter16-Leech":{"title":"Chapter 16-Leech","content":"Jiaojiao woke suddenly, when a handful of something wet and smelly landed on her face. She coughed and grabbed at the mess, coming away with a handful of mud. Min Tong hovered some distance away, giggling into his hands, then jolted when Jiaojiao gave him a distant look.\n\n\"Guai! You leave Rui Si alone!\" he shouted, backing away.\n\nJiaojiao didn't dignify the little cretin with a response, too busy pulling more bits of mud out of her hair.\n\n\"Are you listening, Guai?\"\n\n*Say, Guang Qiu, do I look like I'm easy to push around? First you, Cen Wei, that quack, the idiot rickshaw driver, and even this monkey. All of you seem to believe that I'm a kind person that won't hit back when bullied?*\n\nGuang Qiu floated lazily overhead, radiating waves of shadenfreude . *I don't know what you did in your past life, but it seems you don't have much good karma accumulated.*\n\n*Nonsense,* Jiaojiao's smile got even colder when more children appeared in the doorway of the room, all with handfuls of mud clutched in their hands. *If good people had good ends, then why is there injustice in this world? If anything, the fact that I'm being bullied means that I've simply been too nice.*\n\nJiaojiao reached for her stick, which she'd placed by her side when she'd gone to bed. Her whole body ached after sleeping on the straw mat over a hard wooden floor, but big plus--no cockroaches had crawled into her mouth in the night. She pulled the mask off her face and stowed it in her sleeve. The children drew back, seeing her marked face uncovered.\n\n\"Go on,\" she told them. \"Throw that mud. See what happens.\"\n\nThe children hesitated, looking to Min Tong for guidance.\n\n\"Throw it! She can't chase after you! She's lame!\" Min Tong shouted, puffing out his chest.\n\nThe first child threw his handful of mud, but it fell short and splattered uselessly on the ground by Jiaojiao's feet. More children joined in, until they had all pitched their handfuls.\n\nOnly three shots landed on Jiaojiao at all, the others hitting the ground or the walls.\n\n\"I'll remember you,\" Jiaojiao said, her smile tranquil. \"You should know that vengeful ghosts never forget the faces of those that wrong them.\"\n\nThe children paled, then ran away en mass, leaving Min Tong to face Jiaojiao alone.\n\n\"Are you very proud?\" Jiaojiao asked Min Tong. \"Will Rui Si thank you?\"\n\nAs if on cue, Rui Si ran into the room, her face scrunched up in distress. \"Jiaojiao!\"\n\n\"Good morning,\" Jiaojiao said, rising from the floor with the aide of her staff. She leisurely brushed most of the mud off her robes and hair, as if they were stray snowflakes and not mud from who knows where.\n\n\"Min Tong, why did you get the others to throw mud at Jiaojiao?\"\n\n\"She's a guai! You shouldn't talk with her anymore. What if she--\"\n\n\"She's not a ghost, she's nice! She made me a bracelet!\" Rui Si thrust out her thin wrist.\n\nMin Tong slapped her hand away. \"Why are you wearing these things? You think they will make you prettier?\"\n\nRui Si ducked her head, tugging at her veil with a trembling hand. \"Why do you have to be so mean to Jiaojiao? She is very kind.\"\n\n\"Don't be fooled by her. Just look at her face, she's so ugly, she must have done evil--\"\n\n\"Min Tong, I hate you!\" Rui Si said to the stricken boy and turned to bury her face in Jiaojiao's hip, not caring about the mud at all.\n\nJiaojiao gloated at the pale-faced boy. \"Idiot.\"\n\nMin Tong's eyes leaked angry tears as he punched the door frame and stalked off.\n\n\"Are you okay?\" Jiaojiao asked the little girl.\n\nRui Si sniffed and pulled away from Jiaojiao, wiping residual tears from her eyes. \"I'm not going to be friends with Min Tong anymore!\"\n\n\"Were you ever friends?\" Jiaojiao asked curiously.\n\nShe stared at the floor. \"He shares food with me sometimes. Granny Hua doesn't give me much.\"\n\nJiaojiao's smile turned very brittle. It seemed she needed to have some words with *some* people.\n\n\"You like him because he's kind to you?\"\n\n\"He's going to be a great monk in the future. He said he will become an immortal and make sure every kid here has enough to eat.\"\n\nFrom what Jiaojiao gathered from the book, the great sects did recruit children who had great potential to train into productive members of their sects, but did a child from the slum have this opportunity? Not unless he truly was very gifted. Did Min Tong fall into this category? Why didn't she see it?\n\nRui Si tentatively brushed more dirt from Jiaojiao's side, then pulled at her sleeve. \"I know where to get clothes, come with me.\"\n\nThe two of them limped and stepped into the halls of the ruined temple, striding past leaky windows and cracked beams until they came to a wide room with some chipped furniture stacked up on one side and some cupboards on the other.\n\n\"There are some old clothes from some big sister that married away from here some years ago,\" Rui Si whispered. \"I sometimes come here to play when no one else wants to play with me.\"\n\nJiaojiao imagined a lonely little girl hiding in this big empty room, playing in the dim light from the shadowed windows.\n\n\"Do the other children often not want to play with you?\"\n\nRui Si clutched at the cloth on her face. \"Granny Hua says that only people who led wicked lives in their past reincarnation end up with deformities. Or maybe my parents were criminals.\"\n\nJiaojiao shook her head, lip curled. \"Whether your parents were criminals or saints, what relation does that have to do with you? We come into this world alone and we die alone. Why should we bear the sins of others? As for whether you were wicked in a past life, all that matters is that I don't see a wicked person in front of me now.\"\n\nRui Si looked up at Jiaojiao with wide eyes, as if this chicken soup was the elixir to cure all her ills. Jiaojiao coughed and looked away, unable to meet that naive gaze head on. This is why she planned to never have her own children. What if she screwed them up?\n\n\"So don't worry about being friends with that idiot, Min Tong. If he doesn't like you, there are always others who will.\"\n\n\"He's the leader,\" Rui Si looked down. \"If he doesn't like you, none of them will like you.\"\n\n\"Then you don't need any of them,\" Jiaojiao squatted with difficulty to get at eye level with the little girl. \"Sometimes it's better to have one very good friend that sticks with you always, than to have a lot of them that throw you aside whenever it suits them. Besides, aren't you here with me? Or do you want to throw mud at me too?\"\n\n\"Of course not! I like you, Big Sister!\"\n\n\"You have good taste,\" Jiaojiao said, patting the girl on the head.\n\nJiaojiao found some passable clothing to change into, a dull blue thing that had been washed so many times it had become grey. She tsked at the baggy fit, planning to ask Granny Hua for some thread and a needle later.\n\nThe two girls found some bricks--or mantou to choke down with some millet gruel, the children dodging out of the way when they came into the dining area.\n\n\"Do you know where Tu Wenfeng is?\"\n\n\"He leaves to work before everyone else wakes up.\"\n\nJiaojiao wondered if he'd make any money at all with the bracelets she and Rui Si made the day before. It was hard to gauge whether the ancient peoples had the same aesthetic as those from her old world, after all, so many other things were different, especially beauty standards.\n\nThis era favored plump, soft women, bearded men, and loose fitting clothes that seemed to go on with miles of fabric, all out of style for her time.\n\nJiaojiao didn't have anything to do for the rest of the day. She soon grew very very bored, longing for the past where any random google search could lead her down a bottomless rabbit hole. Why, she could content herself scrolling through various shades of nail polish. Rui Si seemed perfectly content to stick by her side, sitting in the shade of the building on some crooked stools that had seen better days.\n\nGranny Hua led a harried existence, running back and forth minding the various chores around the temple. She swept the yard, her old back craned over the too-short broom. Then she washed linens and hung them out with the help of some of the older children. She washed dishes. She changed the diapers of the youngest child, who could barely walk and tottered about in only a stained dudou. Jiaojiao watched her with yakety sax playing in her head. What else could she do for entertainment?\n\nShe tried to talk to Guang Qiu, attempting to squeeze more information out of him, but he was especially tightlipped today.\n\nJust when she thought she would die of boredom and leave Guang Qiu with yet another vacancy, Tu Wenfeng rushed into the yard, eyes bright, the rickshaw nearly toppling over with his reckless charge. The children yelled and streamed to him like he was a magnet pulling iron filings.\n\n\"I made money!\" he said to Jiaojiao.\n\n\"That's an interesting way to phrase it,\" Jiaojiao said.\n\nHe turned red. \"I meant to say, the things you made yesterday sold very well.\"\n\nRui Si jumped up and laughed. \"How much?\"\n\nTu Wenfeng's expression became guarded. \"I...\"\n\nRui Si cocked her head. \"Do you need help counting it? Is there a lot?\"\n\n\"He wants to lie and pocket some of it for himself,\" Jiaojjiao explained to Rui Si, who's eyes turned red.\n\n\"Tutu, you're very bad!\"\n\n\"I need the money more than you do!\" he argued at last, hand going to his sleeve as if Jiaojiao would jump up and fight him for it.\n\nJiaojiao gave him a bored look. \"To you, Yanyan is the most important thing in the world, but to me, she's just some person who is causing my business partner to cheat me.\"\n\n\"Don't talk about Yanyan that way!\"\n\n*Guang Qiu, wasn't this idiot supposed to be a badass in the book? What is this brainless, money-grubbing simp?*\n\n*He's not had a chance to change into what he should. And he might never become that person if you continue to meddle,* Guang Qiu warned.\n\n\"Well, if you plan to keep a cut of the money, then that means there will be less capital for materials,\" Jiaojiao shook her head. \"You are bleeding the business before it even has a chance to get off its feet.\"\n\n\"Can't we just keep doing what we did before?\" he argued. \"The scraps don't cost a lot of money.\"\n\n\"Imbecile. I simply can't converse with you. It's like talking to a pig.\"\n\n\"Pig-head!\" Rui Si agreed.\n\n\"You promised you would help me,\" Tu Wenfeng said.\n\n\"If you continue to conduct yourself like a leech, then I will treat you like one and cut you off.\"\n\n\"Leech!\"\n\nTu Wenfeng pointed at Jiaojiao, teeth bared. Her eyes widened. Was this guy on drugs? What was going on?\n\n\"You will help me, or I will throw you out of this place!\"\n\n\"Rui Si, he's throwing me out,\" Jiaojiao placed a hand on her brow. \"Whatever shall I do?\"\n\n\"Tutu,\" Rui Si looked up at the teenager, wet with a sheen of tears. \"Why are you being so mean to Jiaojiao?\"\n\n\"She's just some beggar I picked up! If she can't earn her keep, then she doesn't have a place here.\"\n\n\"Do you own the temple?\" Jiaojiao asked, feigning confusion. \"I didn't realize I was speaking to a landlord!\"\n\nTu Wenfeng choked. \"I might not be the owner, but I brought you back. I can drive you out too.\"\n\n\"Then try it. I hope your Yanyan enjoys her new job.\"\n\nThis was quite evidently the wrong thing to say as Tu Wenfeng leapt forward and grabbed the front of Jiaojiao's robes. Unfortunately, Jiaojiao's staff angled just the right way caught him in the throat.\n\nThe teenager went down, wheezing, eyes bulging as he clutched at his throat.\n\n\"Idiots will be idiots, I suppose,\" Jiaojiao tsked. \"Come on Rui Si, let's go inside. Let's ask Granny Hua for some thread. I can make you a new set of clothes.\"\n\nRui Si cheered and helped Jiaojiao hobble upright.\n\nChildren gathered around the fallen Tu Wenfeng, concerned for the wheezing boy. They gave Jiaojiao fearful looks and one ran to find Granny Hua.\n\n\"I told you she was a guai!\" Min Tong trumpeted.\n\nGranny Hua didn't blink an eye at the chaos. She handed Jiaojiao a set of sewing supplies and then tutted, patting Tu Wenfeng on the back. \"Why are you children fighting?\"\n\n\"We have unreconcilable differences. Besides, he's a thief and a cheat who owes me money.\"\n\n\"Tutu, what is going on?\" Granny Hua heaved a deep sigh, her gnarled hands coming to rest on Tu Wenfeng's shoulder. \"I know you care for that girl but that is no reason to behave immorally.\"\n\nTu Wenfeng bowed his head, chastised.\n\n\"This boy has completely lost his head,\" Jiaojiao shook her head. \"I showed him a way to make money, but that doesn't mean I'll work for free. Why does he not understand common sense?\"\n\nGranny Hua glared at Tu Wenfeng. \"I already looked the other way when you stopped donating your earnings to the temple. I should remind you, the rickshaw belongs to me. If you can't see sense, then I will take it back!\"\n\n\"Oh, *snap.*\"\n\nTu Wenfeng bowed his head so low his nose nearly touched his knees. \"I'm sorry Granny Hua, please don't take away the rickshaw.\"\n\n\"How much money is it anyway?\" Granny Hua sighed. \"Five silver taels? Six? Is this little bit enough for you to lie and cheat? What will you become if it's a hundred taels?\"\n\n\"It's twenty taels.\"\n\nGranny Hua's eyes widened, looking back and forth between Tu Wenfeng and Jiaojiao with her milky eyes. \"Twenty?\"\n\nTu Wenfeng nodded, slowly drawing a bulging cloth bag from his sleeve. \"I sold the first one for five *xiao qian*, but they were selling too fast, so I asked for ten, then fifteen *xiao qian*. Then a wealthy man came and bought the rest for ten taels.\"\n\nJiaojiao looked at Tu Wenfeng, who had his chin jutted out like a proud rooster. She could only sneer, looking at this fool who had lost touch of reality for want of cash. \"Are you very happy? Do you think you made a good deal?\"\n\n\"Wasn't it?\" Tu Wenfeng scowled. \"Why?\"\n\n\"If my guess isn't wrong, that same person who bought the rest of the bracelets only wanted to study them. Very soon, someone else will be selling similar bracelets, probably with superior materials. After all, if he had ten taels to throw away on something made from random junk and scraps, he can probably afford to buy the finest leather.\"\n\nTu Wenfeng gawked.\n\n\"Do you still feel clever? Come, tell me.\"","lastmodified":"2022-04-29T11:35:13.400702706Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/Chapter17-Eat-My-Shoe":{"title":"Chapter 17-Eat My Shoe","content":"The next day proved Jiaojiao's premonition was correct. After a lazy morning, during which she and Rui Si continued producing more leather bracelets, Tu Wenfeng came back right before noon, much less excited than he had been the day before. His brows were drawn as he slowly trudged into the courtyard, dragging the rickshaw behind him. The children were wise to his moods and didn't crowd around him as he came before Jiaojiao.\n\n\"The man who bought the rest of the bracelets from me yesterday returned today with his own... imitations,\" Tu Wenfeng admitted. \"You were right, I should not have sold to him.\"\n\nJiaojiao shook her head. \"Even if you hadn't, he would have found a middleman to buy from you, or simply bought it off another customer.\"\n\n\"What do we do? We cannot compete with him. He had three as many bracelets as I did, even the leather was dyed different colors!\"\n\n\"This is a war of resources,\" Jiaojiao nodded. \"We cannot compete with pure monetary power.\"\n\nWasn't this the same as specialty shops versus business giants in her past life? After all, in the interest of competing for a larger consumer base, such companies had to cut down on specialty products, generalizing large sections of their product line to make reproduction easier.\n\n\"Resources are limited, but creativity is endless!\" Jiaojiao smiled. Wasn't this precisely what she was good at? She often made her own accessories in her past life. It was easy for her to come up with new designs.\n\nBesides, heh. Who did these people think they were? Dare to edge in on her budding business? Not on your life! Jiaojiao had a good understanding of herself, and of her needs. She was used to a life where money was just a number. She couldn't bear to continue this hand to mouth existence a second longer! And her comfortable future was directly dependent on this business venture of hers.\n\nJiaojiao tsked. \"Tutu, did you get any of the other things I asked for?\"\n\nTu Wenfeng shuffled awkwardly, still smarting from the smack from reality he'd received. \"I couldn't sell much today, so I bought some of the things you asked for yesterday.\" He handed Jiaojiao a parcel wrapped in a worn cloth.\n\nJiaojiao untied it and took stock with a frown. \"This is all you got?\"\n\n\"Silk is expensive!\"\n\n\"You really are a miserly wretch,\" Jiaojiao scoffed. \"You expect to make money with that sort of attitude? No wonder you came home with your tail between your legs. You've no business sense at all. As soon as my leg heals, I'll go home and you can go back to dragging that dumb cart of yours. Yanyan will thank you for being so wise with money, I'm sure.\"\n\nJiaojiao really knew where to stab Tu Wenfeng where it hurt and also pour salt on the wound.\n\n\"I will do better next time,\" Tu Wenfeng said between gritted teeth.\n\nAfter Chu Hua gave him a stern talking to the day before, his attitude had become more tolerant, if not more friendly.\n\nRui Si cheered, seeing the colorful array of silk cord in the parcel. \"It's beautiful! What are we making today, *da jie*?\"\n\nJiaojiao tested the silk cord with her fingers. It wasn't as finely spun as what could be found in her past life, but it would have to do. \"We will make lucky knots,\" she looked up when Tu Wenfeng made a questioning noise.\n\n\"Don't tell me you don't have them in your wor--er, this country?\"\n\n\"I've never heard of lucky knots. Are you a foreigner?\"\n\nThis was good news, after all, rarity determined price.\n\n\"Are you from Ziguo, perhaps?\"\n\n*Where's Ziguo?* Jiaojiao asked Guang Qiu, who had been increasingly silent as of late.\n\n*It's a country to the south,* Guang Qiu answered, after a slight pause.\n\n*What have you been doing?* she asked it suspiciously. *You've been awfully quiet.*\n\nGuang Qiu didn't answer, simply floating there like a dim ball of ill-intent.\n\nShe narrowed her eyes.\n\n\"Uh, what are you looking at?\" Tu Wenfeng asked, looking like he was worrying for the sanity of his cash cow.\n\n\"Come Rui Si,\" Jiaojiao said at last, with one last glare in Guang Qiu's direction, she nudged the young girl with her hip. \"I'll teach you.\"\n\nRui Si cheered, walking ahead with the parcel of silk cord held in her hands like she was carrying crystal. The other children tried to get a peek at the parcel, but she held it away from them. \"You'll get them dirty!\" she complained, giving a pointed look at their grubby, mud-stained hands.\n\n\"Rui Si, you're still playing with that ghost-face?\" Min Tong asked, bounding to stand in front of Rui Si. \n\nRui Si's eyes narrowed above her veil. \"Don't call her that!\"\n\n\"Ghost-face! Ghost-face!\" Min Tong taunted.\n\nRui Si gave a frustrated growl and dodged to the side. \"You're getting in the way! We're going to make money!\"\n\n\"Stupid!\" Min Tong sneered. \"What kind of money can two women make anyway!\"\n\n\"More than you!\"\n\n\"All right,\" Jiaojiao hobbled after Rui Si and tapped her staff on the ground. \"Why are you stopping to argue with irrelevant people? Just ignore him. We have a lot to do.\"\n\nRui Si sniffed and walked around the red-faced Min Tong. \"Sorry, some people are just too annoying! Good dogs don't block the road!\"\n\nThe other children laughed, but quickly stifled it with their hands when Min Tong turned to them with his fist raised. \"Be quiet! I'm not a dog! I'm going to become an immortal!\" he pointed a finger at Jiaojiao, \"the first thing I'll do is seal you away! Ugly ghost-face!\"\n\n\"Ghost-face! Ghost-face!\" some children echoed, some even bending over to scoop mud off the ground. \n\nJiaojiao turned to Tu Wenfeng. \"You're going to let them treat your money tree like this?\"\n\nTu Wenfeng coughed. \"All right, that's enough!\"\n\nThe children groaned, but threw down their handfuls of mud. The most easily distracted among them bit their lips and wandered off to find other amusements. Min Tong turned purple.\n\n\"Ah, I'm so scared, o' great immortal.\"\n\nRui Si laughed so hard she bent in two, \"great immortal!\"\n\nLater that evening, Min Tong got his revenge when he sat down to a meal of fluffy white rice and pickled vegetables, a great luxury for the children of the temple. Jiaojiao frowned at the wilted vegetables and watery millet the other children and she were forced to choke down.\n\nMin Tong made a great show of blowing on the steaming white rice, lightly scooping a mouthful with a pair of bamboo chopsticks, he placed the morsel in his mouth, then panted when it burned his tongue. \n\n\"Delicious!\" he announced with a groan of satisfaction.\n\n\"What does it taste like?\" a hollow-cheeked child asked, squeezing so close he was nearly sitting in Min Tong's lap.\n\nMin Tong leaned away with a disgusted look. \"Don't breathe in my face!\"\n\n\"I just wanted to get a smell!\"\n\nJiaojiao could only watch this scene with a mixture of bafflement and discomfort. The rice was only the most inferior broken rice, with particles of hulls mixed in. She wouldn't have eaten such fare even if you paid her to in her last life, but it was enough to send these kids scrambling for a mere sniff.\n\n\"Granny Hua really knows how to play favorites.\" Jiaojiao smirked around the rim of her bowl as she swallowed down the tasteless dinner.\n\n\"So what if you can make money, ghost face?\" Min Tong said, placing down his chopsticks with a bang. \"Don't I still eat better than you?\"\n\n\"Idiot who doesn't know the world,\" Jiaojiao tapped the table with her own chopsticks. \"You would think you are eating an imperial banquet from the way you talk.\"\n\nThe other children giggled into their sleeves at Min Tong's purple face.\n\n\"What do you know?\" Min Tong snapped. \"If you've eaten a single mouthful of white rice in your life, I'll--I'll eat my shoe!\"\n\nJiaojiao smacked the table. \"You said it! Don't you forget!\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Tutu!\" Jiaojiao called, snapping her fingers.\n\n\"What?\" he frowned at Jiaojiao form over his own bowl of millet gruel, though his bowl was many times larger.\n\n\"How much does rice cost in the capital? And I don't mean the garbage the *immortal* over there is eating, I mean the good stuff.\"\n\nTu Wenfeng didn't seem to like where the conversation was going. \"Why?\"\n\n\"Just tell me, you miser.\"\n\n\"Its 2 silver per *shi*.\"\n\n\"Then buy two *shi*.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\nJiaojiao slammed her hand on the table. \"I don't tell you what to do with the money you earn yourself, but damned if I have to work while eating this...\" she flicked her half-empty bowl. \"*food*, though I use that term loosely.\"\n\nTu Wenfeng bit at air. \"You don't need a whole *shi*.\"\n\n\"Why are you still arguing with me?\" Jiaojiao was amazed. \"Do you really not understand what I'm saying? You want me to work, but don't let me eat? What kind of person are you?\"\n\n\"You still don't need a whole *shi*.\"\n\n\"Do these children not exist to you?\" Jiaojiao laughed. \"What kind of place is this anyway? One eats white rice, the other eats wind. Quite interesting.\"\n\nTu Wenfeng finally shut up and bent over his bowl, clenching his chopsticks with a trembling fist. Chu Hua followed the conversation from the far end of the table like a ping-pong match, but said nothing. Small mercies.\n\nSome of the smarter children followed the conversation and were now talking animatedly among themselves. Min Tong had turned the color of eggplant.\n\n\"Will we really have rice to eat?\" Rui Si asked Jiaojiao in a whisper.\n\n\"If Tutu can follow simple directions, then yes.\"\n\nRui Si's eyes crinkled, her wide smile hidden under her veil.\n\nAfter dinner, the two girls made more corded bracelets with silk and leather, Rui Si once again proving a quick study to knotwork and braiding. They retired late at night, when their eyes ached from squinting in the low light offered by the single candle Chu Hua generously afforded them.\n\nThe next day, Tu Wenfeng rose before dawn and was long gone by the time Jiaojiao rose from slumber and hobbled her way to morning meal. The children had wisely not thrown mud at her that morning, those smart ones already regretting their past actions, the ones that had taken action anyway. Of the twenty-three children in the temple, Jiaojiao remembered very well that only seven had the temerity to sling mud.\n\nA fact that she demonstrated aptly when Tu Wenfeng returned in the afternoon, stoked with success, two bags of rice in his rickshaw.\n\nThat night, Jiaojiao delicately tasted the rice and pickled vegetables in her bowl while the other children, except a specific seven, dove into their meal like starving rats.\n\n\"Min Tong,\" she said slowly. \"I'm waiting for you to eat your shoe.\"\n\nThis prompted three children to laugh so abruptly they nearly choked on their rice. Rui Si was shaking so hard she almost dropped her bowl. \n\n\"You!\" Min Tong jumped up, throwing down his chopsticks. \"Shut up you, ghost-face! \"\n\n\"What? Is the great immortal not going to honor his words?\"\n\nMin Tong screamed almost threw himself across the table, but Tu Wenfeng caught the back of his shirt.\n\n\"Go outside,\" he barked at the flailing Min Tong. \"Why are you making a scene? Do real men argue with women?\"\n\nMin Tong gasped, angry tears gleaming in his eyes.\n\n\"Hehe, spoken like a true man who can't win an argument.\"\n\nThey boy bit back his words, then pushed Tu Wenfeng's hand away to rush outside.\n\n\"Why do you target the boy?\" Tu Wenfeng asked with a disappointed look.\n\n\"Oh, should I let him throw mud and call me names? Is that how a *virtuous lady* conducts herself?\"\n\nTu Wenfeng frowned, as if unable to answer the question. \"Yes.\"\n\nJiaojiao took another bite of her rice. \"What made you think I was virtuous?\"\n\nThat night, Jiaojiao was settling down for bed when she overheard a conversation in the hallway.\n\n\"Rui Si, you really aren't going to listen to me?\"\n\n\"Why should I listen to you? You're nothing but a bully who doesn't honor his words!\"\n\n\"I didn't really mean it when I said I would eat my shoe!\"\n\n\"I'm not talking about that! I'm talking about--\" Rui Si scoffed. \"Nevermind, what's the use of saying this now? That big sister is already dead.\"\n\n\"You don't know that!\"\n\nJiaojiao edged as quietly as she could to peek around the doorframe. In the low light of the moon, two children stood opposite each other.\n\n\"Why else would she be so scared? She was so kind, she gave you her purse, but you didn't listen to her at all! You told that awful man--\"\n\n\"Why are you talking about this now?\" Min Tong asked in a sharp whisper. \"It's been almost a year!\"\n\n\"You think I would forget something like that?\"\n\n\"You should! I have!\"\n\n\"You think I don't know where Granny Hua got the silver for your rice? If anyone should remember that girl, it should be you!\"\n\n\"I think that ghost face is just putting ideas in your head!\" Min Tong growled. He stepped forward and snatched Rui Si's wrist. \"Is this what she gave you? Is this what she made?\"\n\nOn Rui Si wrist was a charming pink bracelet with knots like flowers.\n\n\"Let go of me!\"\n\n\"She's filling your head with lies!\"\n\nJiaojiao knocked her staff on the wall, like ducks starting from a gunshot, the two kids leapt apart and stared at her, eyes wild. \n\n\"Why are you standing out here, arguing in the middle of the night?\" Jiaojiao complained. \"Why can't you have clandestine conversations in the daylight when it won't interrupt my sleep?\"\n\n\"Big Sis!\"\n\n\"Ghost!\" Min Tong cried.\n\n\"Idiot, have you peed yourself again? Granny Hua will cry.\"","lastmodified":"2022-04-29T11:35:13.400702706Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/Chapter18-Blueprint":{"title":"Chapter 18-Blueprint","content":"\"Jiaojiao!\" Rui Si kicked Min Tong in the shin and darted over to hide behind Jiaojiao. \n\n\"Immortal, are you doing, bullying a girl in the middle of the night?\" Jiaojiao asked, patting Rui Si on the head, feeling her quake as the little girl clutched her robes.\n\n\"W--what? Don't speak nonsense!\" Min Tong screeched, pushing past the two of them to enter the sleeping area.\n\nRui Si calmed as soon as Min Tong left. She looked up at Jiaojiao, eyes dark. \"Big sis, did you hear what we were talking about?\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"Then...\" Rui Si paused.\n\n\"If you don't want to tell me, then I don't need to hear it,\" Jiaojiao yawned and patted her on the back. \"Shouldn't we be sleeping? We have more work tomorrow.\"\n\nThe two entered the sleeping area as well, settling down by their secluded corner, far from the others.\n\n\"Good night, *da jie*,\" Rui Si whispered. Only the barest shape of her form discernible in the pitch black.\n\n*You really don't care about what they were talking about?* Guang Qiu asked suddenly.\n\nJiaojiao cracked open her eyes. The ball floated, a spot of light in her vision, though he cast no light onto his surroundings. Like a selfish star that shared no light.\n\n*You don't talk to me all day, but disturb my sleep? Excellent,* Jiaojiao mocked.\n\n*They were talking about a girl.*\n\n*So? Aren't you always telling me not to meddle? Why fixate on this?*\n\n*You should ask them about her.*\n\n*Hehe. I can't decide, are you trying reverse psychology or something?*\n\nGuang Qiu fell into another prolonged silence. Jiaojiao rolled her eyes in the night and rolled over to turn away from the ball. What an eyesore.\n\nThe next day, Jiaojiao fell into the same routine she had the past three days, though her breakfast was less miserable than the past. She and Rui Si continued braiding and knotting, Min Tong a discontent shadow plaguing the corners of the room. He'd made attempts to rally the children for another mudslinging, but none of them listened. They weren't idiots, they knew where the food came from.\n\nMidday rolled around. A strange squeaking noise came from the entry to the temple courtyard. Jiaojiao frowned and looked out the door. A bruised and battered Tu Wenfeng slouched into view, dragging a rickshaw with a half-broken axle, its left wheel rolling erratically.\n\n\"Oh, I was afraid of this,\" Jiaojiao sighed. \n\n\"Tutu!\" the children screamed and crowded around him. \n\nA few seconds later, Granny Hua came in a panicked scurry, as much as an arthritic old woman could scurry, anyway, her hands still wet from doing laundry. \"Wenfeng, what happened?\"\n\nThe teenager didn't answer, letting go of the cart shafts with a thud, he avoided eyes as he came up to Jiaojiao, favoring his left leg.\n\n\"You look terrible.\"\n\n\"The man hired a thug to beat me up,\" Tu Wenfeng confessed in a low whisper. \"He even bribed a guard to look the other way when they came to stop them.\"\n\n\"Who won?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry?\"\n\n\"Who won the fight?\"\n\nTu Wenfeng gave Jiaojiao a confused look. \"There was no fight. I didn't fight back.\"\n\n*Excuse me?* Jiaojiao thought. *This is the feared Black Wind as mentioned in the books?*\n\n*I did warn you to not interfere with the characters before the time was correct,* Guang Qiu said smugly. *Black Wind? I won't be surprised if he becomes Pink Breeze at this rate.*\n\n\"Nevermind,\" Jiaojiao waved a hand. \"How badly hurt are you? Can you still pull a cart tomorrow?\"\n\nTu Wenfeng looked up, his pride bruised, face gray. \"What use is it? That man will beat me up again if I try to sell tomorrow. He might even have me killed.\"\n\n\"Idiot,\" Jiaojiao scoffed. \"Are you so dumb that you can't even think of moving to another area?\"\n\nTu Wenfeng paused, eyes lighting up. \"That's right, there's no way he can cover the whole city.\" He frowned. \"But that area was the most busy. I won't be able to make the same amount of money if I go elsewhere. Besides, what if this happens again?\"\n\n\"It probably will,\" Jiaojiao agreed, \"but what's the use of worrying? All we can do is take each day as it comes. We are mice living in a world of giants.\"\n\n*Heh, at least you have perspective,* Guang Qiu said.\n\n\"Tu Wenfeng, I've proven I'm not just a fool who talks too much but now, haven't I?\"\n\nTu Wenfeng scowled. \"What do you want me to buy now?\"\n\n\"Heh, this miser. You need to spend money to make money! How many times have I told you this already? Isn't that mobster the best example?\"\n\n\"A mob what?\"\n\n\"That evil boss I've yet to meet,\" Jiaojiao smiled and touched her chin. *I wouldn't mind having a* talk *with that fellow once I'm no longer a cripple.*\n\n*You won't fix that poison without the artifact,* Guang Qiu reminded.\n\n*All things in their time.*\n\nJiaojiao sent the limping Tu Wenfeng out of the temple once more on an errand. Granny Hua barely had time to wipe the blood on his face before he set off. She gave Jiaojiao a murky look but finally waved her hand with a sigh. \"I have too much to do around the temple to worry about the business of the younger generation.\"\n\n\"Don't worry too much,\" Jiaojiao said without care. \"I'm only sending him out the buy things. Even if he runs into those thugs again, he can just run away. He can run so fast dragging a rickshaw, I can only imagine how fast he'll be without it.\" \n\nThe \"feng\" in Tu Wenfeng wasn't there for show.\n\n\"Besides, I doubt they'll come after him again on the same day.\"\n\nTu Wenfeng returned a few hours later, no worse than he'd been when he'd left. His bruises were turning an angry purple, but other than that...\n\n\"What took you so long?\" Granny Hua asked, pausing in her sweeping.\n\nTu Wenfeng avoided the old woman's eyes. \"I went to visit someone.\"\n\n\"Yanyan?\"\n\n\"No!\" Tu Wenfeng blushed.\n\nNaturally not. Jiaojiao thought with a smirk. How could a young boy let his crush see him after getting creamed in a fight--er, one-sided beating.\n\n\"I went to see the madame to ask for an extension,\" he admitted with a bowed head. \"There's just so little time, I'm afraid...\"\n\n\"Tutu,\" Jiaojiao held out her hand.\n\nTu Wenfeng gave Jiaojiao a rare, pleading look. \"Please, I cannot do this without your help.\"\n\nJiaojiao simply kept her hand out, palm up. Tu Wenfeng placed the parcel in her hand. \"I still need fifty taels.\" \n\nJiaojiao sat down at the low table,  spreading out the materials with a critical eye. The paper was far from the quality she could expect from her past life, but at least it wasn't toilet paper. Similarly, the inkstone and brush were inferior to what she'd used in the past.\n\nShe spent a laborious fifteen minutes grinding ink before the pigment was sufficiently thick. \n\n*You know calligraphy?* Guang Qiu asked in a strange, disbelieving voice.\n\n*What's so surprising?* Jiaojiao asked, dipping the bamboo handled brush into the ink well. *I am after all, of Chinese heritage.*\n\n*Chinese?* Guang Qiu sneered emphasizing each character. *Middle kingdom? You mortals really know how to self aggrandize. Frogs in a well, one and all!*\n\nJiaojiao shrugged. *Isn't this instinct? Perhaps some other being would look at you and say the same.* \n\n*Impossible! We are above--we--there is no one else!*\n\nJiaojiao didn't care for the ball's blustering. *Isn't there a saying? Mountains beyond mountains, heavens beyond heavens? How can you be so sure?*\n\n*There simply isn't. You just worry about your own little mountain.*\n\nJiaojiao shrugged. *Wasn't I perfectly fine on my mountain? You're the one that dragged me off of it.*\n\n*Might I remind you that--*\n\n*Yes, yes, whatever. But I don't think you were really doing me a favor. After all, since the cycle of reincarnation exists, doesn't that mean you yanked me out of it?*\n\nGuang Qiu fell silent.\n\n*Hehe, for all your talk about not disturbing the cycle of reincarnation, you didn't seem to have a problem disturbing mine. Hypocrite.*\n\n*You really think you are safe from punishment, mortal? I may not be able to do anything to you now but just wait--*\n\n*Then I'm waiting,* Jiaojiao said and no longer paid attention to the fuming Guang Qiu.\n\nJiaojiao sat down on the low dining table, lips pursed as she labored in the flickering light of one of Chu Hua's precious candles. The old woman was so loathe to part with it, you might think Jiaojiao was burning money. She spent the evening and most of the night drawing on the paper, using a bamboo slip as a straight-edge. \n\nSlowly, with the inferior brush that periodically shed hairs, Jiaojiao sketched out a complex blueprint. Guang Qiu made several attempts to ask her about it, but Jiaojiao never deigned to answer him, too caught up in her work.\n\nThe next day, with shadowed eyes and aching shoulders, she sat in the back of the hastily repaired rickshaw as Tu Wenfeng hauled her to the craftsman's district, wobbly wheel squeaking with every revolution. Jiaojiao held her hand to her face, shielding it from the light and from curious eyes. She didn't have makeup to cover the mark on her face and she was too tired worry about what might happen if word got out that the notorious disfigured Bai Xingyue, \"future empress\" was seen riding in the back of a peasant's rickshaw. By the now the Bai family should have realized she was missing. Jiaojiao didn't have the spare brain cells to think of countermeasures at the moment.\n\nShe let the sounds of the busy city sift through one ear and out the other. The quality of this body was too terrible. Back on Earth, pulling an all nighter, while something she avoided like the plague because it did horrible things to the complexion, was not something that tax her like she'd been run over by a sixteen-wheeler. \n\nWhen the rickshaw finally pulled to a squeaky stop, Jiaojiao peeled open her eyes to see the sooty walls of a stone compound. \n\n\"It's here,\" Tu Wenfeng said, swiping the sweat from his brow. \"He's supposed to be very affordable, but his temper is eccentric.\"\n\nJiaojiao half hopped, half fell from the rickshaw, catching herself with her staff. As always, Tu Wenfeng stood to the side, refusing to help her, because god forbid he touch a finger of a woman other than his precious Yanyan, and even then he might not until the night of their hypothetical wedding. Ancient propriety was such a pain in the ass.\n\nInside the courtyard, the ringing of hammers striking steel grew louder, striking at Jiaojiao's eardrums and irritating her nascent migraine.\n\n\"Hello?\" she called to the muscular man laboring at the forge.\n\n\"Hello?\" she said again when he didn't look up.\n\nThe man didn't so much as twitch an eyebrow at Jiaojiao's presence, content to continue striking at the red-hot metal taking shape on the anvil. His arms and most of his chest was sweaty and randomly marked with ash. His short beard was dotted with scorch marks and Jiaojiao could only tsk in disapproval. The poor man needed a shower and a stylist. How could anyone go out with his beard so untidy and half-burned off she didn't know. \n\nJiaojiao supposed she could afford to wait. Tu Wenfeng had warned her that the smith was eccentric. She sighed and leaned against the cleanest part of the wall to wait. Her leg was more or less healed, but she didn't remove the splint, not wanting to risk anything going wrong with her leg.\n\nAlmost thirty minutes later, the man put down his hammer, then started when he noticed Jiaojiao in his peripheral vision.\n\n\"I must be drunk?\" he told himself. \"Why am I seeing ghosts in broad daylight?\"\n\n\"I'm human, thanks,\" Jiaojiao said. \"Never seen an ugly girl before?\"\n\n\"I've seen ugly. This is worse.\" The man drew a bucket of water from a nearby well and dumped it overhead. \n\n\"Haha. Anyway, I have a job for you.\"\n\nThe man perked up in an instant. \"What can I do for you?\"\n\n\"I have a blue-print. Perhaps you can take a look at it and we can discuss prices.\"\n\nThey retired to the reception area. The man hunched his broad shoulders over the low table, sipping cold tea without a care as he squinted at the paper. Jiaojiao frowned at the cup he'd generously poured her and left it untouched.\n\n\"This paper quality is terrible.\"\n\n\"I'm poor.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Do you need to know to build it?\"\n\nThe man crossed his thick arms. \"I suppose not, but it would be easier to make if I understood its purpose.\"\n\n\"Its a lathe.\"\n\n\"A lathe?\" the man looked up. \"Is it some sort of magical device?\"\n\n\"You can regard it as such.\"\n\n\"Very well, I can create something according to these blueprints. Ingenious design. Might I know the name of the man who created it?\"\n\n\"Jiaojiao.\"\n\nThe man blinked. \"Dragon, dragon? Very fierce.\"\n\n\"No, it's *jiao*.\" She wrote the character in the air.\n\n\"Do men generally call themselves Jiao? How strange.\"\n\n\"The man is actually a woman, and the woman is me.\"\n\nThe man stared at Jiaojiao, then threw his head back and laughed. \"Very funny. Your master must be a very kind one if he employs the deformed and even allows them to make such jokes at their own expense.\"\n\nThe man's face then turned stern. \"But I don't like disobedient servants. Get out of my shop and tell your master to send someone who knows how to conduct themselves.\"","lastmodified":"2022-04-29T11:35:13.400702706Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/Chapter19-A-Deal":{"title":"Chapter 19-A Deal","content":"\"Why do you assume that I'm lying? Because I'm young? Or because I'm a woman?\" \n\nThe man threw back the rest of his cold tea and rose from his seat. \"Both.\"\n\nHe indicated the door with his hand, a clear dismissal.\n\nJiaojiao leaned back on her hands, a smile that was not really a smile on her lips. \"There really is no shortage of fools in this world.\"\n\nThe man stopped, a hostile set to his shoulders, though his face remained genial. \"Oh?\"\n\n\"If I really were lying, it would be easy to prove right now. Why are you in such a rush to drive me away? Can it be a capable woman is so hard to tolerate?\"\n\nThe man laughed angrily. \"Good! Then we shall see if you are telling the truth, or if your mind is as ugly as your face!\"\n\nJiaojiao watched, expression mild as the man stalked out of the room indicating that she follow with a jerk of his head.\n\nShe took a leisurely hobble through the building into a study. The surroundings were tidy and though not rich, they were at least comfortable, with well maintained windows and clean floors. Sketches of weapons, namely swords and other knives, though there were spearheads as well, filled every surface, piled high up on the shelves and the desk without a care. The man swept an area clean with a brutish hand and slapped down a brush, an inkstone and an inkstick.\n\nJiaojiao rolled her eyes and prepared the ink herself, the man watching her movements with crossed arms. \n\n\"It seems your master really trusts you if he lets you near the study,\" he observed, noting her fine movements. \"Look how practiced you ware. You must have spent many days grinding ink if you're so proficient.\"\n\nJiaojiao was simply lamenting the difference in resources, the inkstick was of much better quality than the one she'd used last night. She spent far less time grinding out enough pigment and soon started writing and sketching. The brush was like that of finest weasel hair and the ink emerged from it like butter. \n\nHer hand flew and within a few minutes she blew on the ink to dry it and gave it to the man to peruse.\n\n\"What is this?\" he asked, scowling.\n\n\"It's a schematic for another, simpler tool.\"\n\n\"What's the use of it?\"\n\nJiaojiao spent the next minute explaining how modern nail clippers worked in excessive detail. The man's expression grew brighter as the explanation went on.\n\n\"Ingenious,\" he admitted, \"but this doesn't prove that you are the creator of that other schematic. The two are not in the same class of difficulty.\"\n\n\"Then I have nothing else to say,\" Jiaojiao smiled. \"Even the best doctor cannot cure a man who is willfully blind.\"\n\n\"Who are you calling blind?!\"\n\n\"Heh.\" She rose from her seat at the low study table. Ancient furniture was such a pain in her leg. \"I didn't name names, if you identify as blind then that is your own problem. Anyway, It seems I will have to take my business elsewhere. Please, return my drawings.\"\n\nThe man scowled and reluctantly held the two papers out to her with soot-blackened hands. \n\n\"I can make it for you,\" he said at last, grudgingly.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know if I can afford such a great god as yourself. After all I am a mere woman.\"\n\n\"Your master--\"\n\n\"Is *myself*. I may be poor and humble--\"\n\nGuang Qiu scoffed.\n\n\"--but I am no one's servant.\" Jiaojiao threw the man a careless wave goodbye and began to leave.\n\n\"Wait.\"\n\n\"I'm very busy.\"\n\n\"Forgive my disrespect!\" The man said his head dipped. \"I was too hasty to judge you by your appearance.\"\n\n\"Then what? Can you give me a discount? I'm very poor.\"\n\n\"You can sell these schematics to me!\" The man proposed. \"I won't cheat you.\"\n\n\"That depends on how much you offer.\"\n\nThe two sat down to discuss prices at the tea table, this time with a fresh pot of fine tea that tasted very much like Pu'er. Jiaojiao sipped it with eyes narrowed in enjoyment. She wasn't much of a tea drinker--it caused too much teeth staining--but she was craving any taste that wasn't pickled vegetables, millet, or plain white rice.\n\n\"How much are you willing to offer?\" Jiaojiao asked.\n\n\"The *lathe*, I do not understand its usage, can you explain it more clearly to me?\" the man coughed.\n\n\"It's a machine to quickly and accurately shape many of the same parts at once. This particular lathe is only suitable for making one thing,\" Jiaojiao said. \n\n\"And what is that?\"\n\n\"Beads.\"\n\nThe man hummed in thought. \"For jewelry?\"\n\nJiaojiao nodded. \"This mechanism here is a way to adjust sizes.\"\n\n\"What is this unit?\" The man asked, pointing at a scale on the corner of the page. \"I'm not familiar with this *centimeter.*\"\n\nJiaojiao didn't care for the ancient measurements of *cun* and *chi*. As for whether the centimeter measurement she'd indicated was accurate, she had no true way of knowing. Unless a ruler transmigrated to her location.\n\nJiaojiao went on to have an involved discussion about the metric system, the man opposite her growing ever less skeptical of her as time grew on.\n\n\"How did you come up with this idea?\" he asked at last, after a conversation that spanned three cups of tea.\n\n\"I didn't. I'm merely sharing information from my homeplan--err, hometown.\"\n\nJiaojiao paused. *Guang Qiu, you're not concerned at all about me starting an industrial boom in this era?* she asked the ball, who was behaving uncharacteristically mild.\n\n*Will you listen if I say no, mortal? Don't do it. Please stop?* it asked.\n\n*Well. Do you want me to lie to you?*\n\nA distinct emotion of resigned irritation wafted from its direction before it went back to glowing dimly in her peripheral vision.\n\n\"Miss?\" the man asked, look at her in concern. \"What are you looking at?\"\n\n\"Nothing, I was just lost in thought. Have you decided how much you want to pay for the machine?\" Jiaojiao asked.\n\nThe man stroked his half-burnt beard. \"I will be honest with you, the potential for this machine is very big, but I have little use for a machine that can only make beads.\"\n\n\"You can make it and sell it to others who do have a use for it. Artisans for example.\"\n\nThe man sucked a breath through his teeth. \"It's hard to say whether artisans would understand how to operate such a machine. They might even dislike it as a profanity toward tradition.\" \n\nJiaojiao nodded. Such sentiments had risen during the industrial era as many traditional craftsman suffered lost of livelihood.\n\n\"Besides, it would take me a long time just to make one machine,\" the man complained. \"Even just one part of this machine might take me a whole day of forging. The most complex parts might even take me a week to make one.\"\n\nJiaojiao listened to the man hem and haw, wise to his strategy. He wasn't wrong, per-say, but who knew what would happen to this blueprint after he got a hold of it? So what if he himself would take hours to forge one machine? \n\nWhat if he hired many others to forge more machines? Did he really think Jiaojiao was an idiot? That she didn't realize that the blueprint was in fact, priceless?\n\nOnce one understood the mechanics, it wasn't difficult to adapt the lathe to make a variety of other parts. It was after all, the lathe that spawned the industrial revolution in her own world. \n\nBut Jiaojiao didn't care for impossible, far-flung dreams and hypotheticals. She just wanted to be comfortable *now*.\n\n\"I'll give it to you for ten gold ingots, and a copy of the machine,\" she said.\n\n\"Deal!\" the man smiled, looking very much like a greasy car salesman who had just closed a pyrrhic deal. Pyrrhic on the part of the customer, of course.\n\n\"Give it to me in silver. I don't want to have to go through the trouble of exchanging it after all,\" Jiaojiao added.\n\nThe man nodded agreeably and took a long sip of his tea.\n\n*He's obviously cheating you,* Guang Qiu said. *Why are you letting him take advantage?*\n\n*So what? He thinks he has the better end of the deal, but who knows who will come out on top in the end,* Jiaojiao thought mysteriously. *Besides, it's not like I invented the lathe. I myself are merely appropriating someone else's invention. What right do I have to get proprietary?*\n\nJiaojiao didn't believe it would be so easy to birth an industrial revolution. So what if she spread this core technology? It was just a single idea and only one contributing factor to an age of dreams, both hopeful and nightmarish. \n\nThis was the crux of the matter. To start an industrial boom needed an accumulation. An accumulation of knowledge, of resources, of time. An advance needed many great minds working together toward a single goal, and even then it might end in disappointment. It wasn't something a single girl could accomplish with a single idea.\n\nTen minutes later, Jiaojiao hobbled into the front of the forge area, the tang of hot metal stung her nostrils. A handful of teenaged apprentices were working in the forge area, keeping the temperature in the blast furnace constant even while their master sipped tea.\n\nHer sleeves and waist were heavy with coin. She was quite satisfied, but stopped short at the sight of a figure standing near the forges, complexion rapidly draining of blood.\n\n*Look!* Guang Qiu shot out, form blazing with light. *It's him!*\n\n*Not this again,* Jiaojiao groaned, then turned away, *far away in the opposite direction.*\n\nMo Wudi was standing in the yard. Why was Mo Wudi standing in the yard? Why was this creepy masked weirdo still around? *Why?*\n\n*Where was he supposed to be during this part of the plot?* Jiaojiao muttered. *Wasn't Bai Jing still at the Bai estate? Hadn't he fixated on her by then and insisted on showing up in her surroundings unannounced?*\n\n*But there's no Bai Jing now,* Guang Qiu said triumphantly, *which means he's free to turn up wherever the wind takes him! Including this place!*\n\nJiaojiao wanted to bang her head on the nearest pillar and end all her troubles. Why must she meet this psycho on the road?\n\n*Go talk to him! Maybe he can help you retrieve the artifact!*\n\n*Hehe, and maybe we'll ride a flying pig into a cotton candy sunset. Wake up! You still think he'll help us? For what reason? We are strangers! And I'd like to keep it that way!*\n\n\"Bai Xingyue.\"\n\n*He's calling for you!* Guang Qiu squealed like a little fangirl at a k-pop concert.\n\n*My name isn't Bai Xingyue!* Jiaojiao roared in her mind, her staff and legs worked overtime as she retreated into the blacksmith's reception area.\n\n\"What are you doing back here?\" The smith asked in surprise, on his way out.\n\n\"I met an ill omen and had to take a detour.\"\n\n\"Heh! What can be more frightening than your face?\" the smith jested.\n\n\"Haha, very funny, see how I laugh. Do you have a back exit to this place?\" Jiaojiao got a prickling sensation of deja vu.\n\n\"What has you frightened so?\" the smith asked in concern. \"Don't tell me there's really a ghost out there.\"\n\n\"There's only me,\" said a deep, magnetic voice. It brought to mind thunderstorms and chocolate.\n\nJiaojiao could see people objectively and appreciate them for their beauty even if she personally had no wish to get involved with them. Mo Wudi had a *very* nice voice.\n\nShe turned around, stiff, as if her waist were in the process of petrification. \"Hello. We meet again.\"\n\nThe masked figure made a standard greeting salute, cupping his hands with perfect etiquette. His every nuanced movement like martial poetry.\n\n\"Bai Xingyue,\" he said, prompting the hairs to rise on the back of Jiaojiao's neck. \"We need to speak.\"\n\n\"Haha, what could we possibly have to speak about?\" Jiaojiao asked, perplexed, panicked, and perspiring. \"We have nothing to do with each other.\"\n\n\"We indeed have nothing to do with each other,\" he said. \"Nevertheless, I still need to speak with you.\"\n\n\"But I don't need to speak with you,\" Jiaojiao edged away, her hand tight around her staff like a lifeline.\n\n\"Don't let her leave.\"\n\n\"Yes, master,\" the smith said, moving to block Jiaojiao's retreat with his considerable bulk.\n\nJiaojiao had a terrible thought.\n\nMo Wudi had four members in his inner circle, deputies in his *Abyss Syndicate*. One of them Dian Zhuo, happened to be a swarthy blacksmith. A gruff, but shrewd man who rivaled Doctor Tai in his pursuit of money, only he was far more successful in making it. Where Doctor Tai was half beggared with his failing clinic, Dian Zhuo was highly successful, owning a chain of smithies that spanned a third of Languo.\n\n*You still think you got a good deal?* Guang Qiu mocked.","lastmodified":"2022-04-29T11:35:13.400702706Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/Chapter20-The-Coincidence":{"title":"Chapter 20-The Coincidence","content":"\"Give me back my blueprints,\" Jiaojiao said throwing the bag of gold in Dian Zhuo's face. He caught it an inch from his nose. \"The deal it off.\"\n\n\"Money has already exchanged hands,\" Dian Zhuo protested.\n\nJiaojiao thrust out her hand. \"The blueprint!\"\n\nDian Zhuo smirked and threw back the bag of gold. \"I refuse.\"\n\nJiaojiao caught the bag with difficulty, wrist aching from the strength of the toss.\n\n\"If you throw that bag again, I will keep it *and* the blueprints,\" Dian Zhuo warned, pointing a finger at Jiaojiao. \"Just behave and wait for me to have conversation with this gentleman.\"\n\n*Behave? What am I, a child?*\n\n*You have not undergone your hair-pinning ceremony, so you are still a girl,* Guang Qiu said.\n\n*I'm already twenty-three. I am am grown-ass woman, okay? Get it straight. The body may be young but the mind hasn't regressed, okay?*\n\n\"Master, why have you come?\" Dian Zhuo asked.\n\nMo Wudi untied the sword from his waist and presented it to Dian Zhuo with both hands.\n\n\"I see, it has been a while since I last sharpened it,\" Dian Zhuo said.\n\nJiaojiao tried to limp away from the two men, but Dian Zhuo easily sidestepped and blocked her way with a single stride. She moved in the other direction, but he followed, a strange quirk to his mouth. \"Where do you think you're going?\"\n\n\"Are you still a human being? Or a dog who doesn't know better?\" Jiaojiao said, a very stiff smile on her face. \n\n\"You will speak politely, or not at all!\" Dian Zhuo said, clapping his hands together. A teenaged apprenticed darted from the forge area, bowing slightly to Mo Wudi and his master. \n\n\"Take this girl inside and make sure she doesn't go anywhere.\"\n\n\"Yes master,\" the boy said, reaching sooty, sweaty, and callused hands toward Jiaojiao.\n\nJiaojiao seldom cursed. At least not out loud. She prided herself on her self-control, and in fact, believed her self-control to be very good. \n\nIn her past life, society came with some guarantees. For example, if you behaved yourself, you could be expected to receive some basic measure of respect, whether it be from your peers, your family, or society. There might be some outliers who would go out of their way to disrespect you, but they were in the minority, and they would in turn receive condemnation for such behavior.\n\nThere was so much she didn't understand about this world, other than that she had been brought here for some goddamned mission she wanted no part in. That her old way of life was becoming less and less relevant. That her priceless self control was worthless here.\n\nTo hell with it. What was the use of controlling yourself when you could not control others around you. Why behave when you weren't rewarded for it?\n\n\"Go fuck your mom,\" Jiaojiao said to Mo Wudi. \n\nMo Wudi grew very very still, like a polar ice cap right before it collapsed into the sea, bringing with it an entire ecosystem. \"What?\"\n\n\"I said, go fuck your mom.\"\n\nDian Zhuo was hilariously wide-eyed, mouth hanging open. \"Little girl--\"\n\n\"Why don't you fuck your mom, too? Why don't you all go fuck your moms?\" She added to the shocked apprentice, who had paused with his hand in midair, still reaching for her.\n\n\"Little girl! The mouth is the mother of disaster,\" Dian Zhuo warned. \"Behave yourself!\"\n\n*Behave,* there was that word again. *Behave.*\n\n \"Why are you suddenly so angry? To speak that way to the master--\"\n\n\"Why am I angry? Is this how you conduct business? Randomly detaining your guests? How unique.\" Jiaojiao said, applauding sarcastically. \"Behave, he says. Why does man never look at himself before lecturing others? The world is full of blustering fools who think the heavens owe them a debt. Behave? Why the hell should I? What the hell is the point?\"\n\n\"Worse than a marketplace shrew!\" Dian Zhuo said. \"What has you possessed? This ugly lingering spirit has the daring to insult master's mother. Her tongue should be cut out.\"\n\nJiaojiao was accustomed to verbal damnation. She was after all, an internet celebrity in her past life, subject to the criticism of anyone who had access to a keyboard. \n\n\"My tongue should be cut out? Why? Because it says truths you don't want to hear? You think I don't know you were cheating me with that deal? I just didn't care to speak with an uncultured, money-hungry thug any longer. Did you think I didn't notice you trying to dig for more secrets? You think a dull mind is capable of designing that machine? Idiot! Imbecile! Naive.\"\n\nDian Zhuo gave an angry growl and reached for Jiaojiao. \"You will be silent.\"\n\n\"Fuck your mom. Fuck your sister. Fuck your dad. Fuck your uncle. And most of all, go fuck yourself!\" Jiaojiao cursed.\n\nThere was a sudden, uproarious crack and a Jiaojiao shut her eyes as a blinding flash of purple light lanced her eyes. The taste of sizzling ozone ran across Jiaojiao's tongue. A rumble of collapsing stone sent a shock of dust and grit pouring over the smithy. \n\nJiaojiao coughed, then blinked the tears from her eyes, her scalded retinas aching with white afterimages.\n\nMo Wudi stood in the trembling silence, arm raised, tip of his hand crackling with residual energy. The entire east wall of the smithy was gone, replaced by a blackened, smoking trail of rubble. \n\n\"Shut up.\"\n\nJiaojiao, who rarely ever felt shock, was shocked into a rare silence. She'd known, in theory, that there were magic powers in this world. That physical strength was the lowest common denominator among the truly strong. Spirit energy, the true source of power in this world, was capable of some epic shit. Epic shit that could apparently dust a wall with a flick of a finger, even at the lower ends of the spectrum. Yes, Mo Wudi, in all his wall-breaking glory, was of the mere Qi Condensation stage. A baby immortal.\n\n*Domineering!* Guang Qiu cheered.\n\n\"Did you have to break my wall?\" Dian Zhuo complained.\n\nMo Wudi simply lowered his arm and proceeded  to have a long conversation with Dian Zhuo about the repair job on his sword. The apprentice had long made himself scarce in the aftermath of Mo Wudi's outburst. The confused voices in the surroundings indicated that there was chaos out in the streets as people wondered what had happened, but the two men conversing in the courtyard took no heed of it.\n\nJiaojiao stared at Guang Qiu, lost in thought.\n\n*You knew he would be here.*\n\n*What?* Guang Qiu said.\n\n*You knew this psycho would be here,* she indicated Mo Wudi with the slightest tip of her head. *That's why you've been so quiet.*\n\n*So what if I did?*\n\n*It seems things aren't as simple as I thought. The events of the book, while some details can be changed at will with my actions, the larger plot points have a way of making themselves known.* she paused. *For example, Tu Wenfeng. Doctor Tai. Dian Zhuo and Mo Wudi. What are the chances that I would meet all four of them just randomly walking about a city?*\n\n*Destiny has its own momentum.* Guang Qiu said simply, and with finality.\n\nJiaojiao chewed on this. What did that mean for her? She gave a sideways look at Mo Wudi. His porcelain demon mask blocked any insight to his present expression. His perfect body posture gave no clues to his present mood, and his voice, while textured like velvet, was entirely monotone.\n\nOne of the biggest plot arcs in the book was Bai Jing and Mo Wudi's epic romance, though the first five hundred chapters only covered them beginning a tentative back and forth with some light kissing and hugging, Jiaojiao could read between the lines. They were *destined*.\n\nDid that mean she was doomed to fall in love with this psychotic wall-breaking muscle-head? \n\n*Hah.*\n\nJiaojiao waited, her arms and legs growing numb from standing in the same position for too long. It was nearly thirty minutes before Mo Wudi concluded his discussion with Dian Zhuo about the routine repair on his sword. \n\nThe teenager's obsessive tendencies were on full display. Even Dian Zhuo was looking fatigued by the overly detailed conversation that ranged from the number of times the sword needed to be run over the grindstone for sharpening, the angle of the blade on the grindstone, the varying grits to use on the blade and in what order et cetera. Jiaojiao's eyes had long glazed over in boredom. By the time Mo Wudi had concluded his instructions on the rations of various tung oil to used on the blade, even Dian Zhuo couldn't take it anymore and cut his master off with a-- \"Ah! It's getting late, lets' continue this discussion inside!\" Then hurried indoors with a fleet step, seeming to completely overlook the presence  of Jiaojiao.\n\nJiaojiao took that oversight to edge toward the exit, but Mo Wudi angled his body towards her, the blackened eyeholes of his mask staring.\n\nHe said nothing, but Jiaojiao got the gist. *I'm watching you.*\n\nShe reluctantly followed Dian Zhuo indoors under the careful eyes of Mo Wudi, who crept behind her, soundless as a shadow. She envied his easy grace, longing for the days when she too, could move like a dancer. \n\n*You think you're so hot?* she cursed the boy in her mind. *My past body could have put yours to shame.*\n\n*Unlikely,* Guang Qiu said with a snort. *Mo Wudi has a Heaven Grade Spirit Root of the Thunder Element, and a Yang Physique. Such qualifications are priceless even in the overworld.*\n\n*Overworld?*\n\nGuang Qiu choked. *None of your business.*\n\nJiaojiao took a note of it. In other words this world was one of a \"lower\" variety. She shook her head. She only had the first five hundred chapters of the book. While that might seem like a lot, it was only a fraction of a five thousand chapter series. She knew very little about the world of Shaofu.\n\nMo Wudi, Dian Zhuo and Jiaojiao were soon seated at a dining table, the latter two sipping tea served by a nervous apprentice who nearly emptied a teapot on Mo Wudi with his shaking hands. Dian Zhuo irately dismissed this apprentice and poured tea for his master himself. Jiaojiao, clearly had to pour her own tea. She rolled her eyes, leg pinched with discomfort as she knelt one-legged in order to do so.\n\n\"Are you finally done talking about your sword?\" Jiaojiao asked with a peeved smile. \"Maybe you would like to discuss the number of silk strands needed in the tassels?\"\n\n\"That is a good point,\" Mo Wudi agreed.\n\nJiaojiao nearly slammed her head into the table. \n\n*Why is he like this? Was this always part of his character setting?* she asked Guang Qiu. *He did came off as a bit stodgy in the books, but this is ridiculous!*\n\nGuang Qiu's light swirled in thought. *Perhaps... Bai Jing inspired him to be less so?*\n\n*Isn't it always her?* Jiaojiao griped. *This golden rainbow Mary Sue special snowflake girl?*\n\n*Is it still a rainbow if it's gold?* Guang Qiu asked.\n\nMo Wudi concluded another exhausting conversation about silk tassels  in fifteen minutes. This time Jiaojiao did not make another sarcastic aside. Who knew if he would take it seriously?\n\n\"Master,\" Dian Zhuo coughed. \"I have a proposition.\"\n\n\"Speak.\"\n\n\"I think we should recruit this girl,\" he indicated Jiaojiao with a thick finger. \"She has brains. We can use her.\" He showed Mo Wudi the two blueprints Jiaojiao had sold to him. \n\nJiaojiao rolled her eyes. \"Is anyone going to ask me if I agree? No wait, that would be considerate, I forget I'm in a land of savages.\" she shook her head and sipped tea.\n\n\"The two men looked at her with cold eyes.\n\n\"I will speak to her in private,\" Mo Wudi said.\n\nDian Zhuo nodded and cupped his hands before leaving with a last, gloating look at Jiaojiao.\n\nMo Wudi waited for the heavy footsteps to die away before speaking.\n\n\"You,\" Mo Wudi spoke, slowly, ponderously, as if every word was costing him undue processing power. \"Are, Bai Xingyue?\"\n\n\"Oh?\" Jiaojiao said, setting  her tea cup down hard enough to chip the bottom. \"This is what you wanted to talk to me about? Weren't you very sure? Why is this phrased like a question now?\"\n\n\"You, are her,\" Mo Wudi spoke again, haltingly. \"But, you also are not her.\"\n\n*Don't tell him the truth!* Guang Qiu warned, finally realizing the danger.\n\nJiaojiao smirked. \"I'm really not her. How did you know?\"\n\n\"Because I spoke with her, before she drowned to death in my pond.\"\n\nWait. What? *She Ma*? NA-the-fuck-NI?\n\n*What?* Guang Qiu said, then proceeded to make a horrific sound reminiscent of dial-up modems.\n\nJiaojiao held up a hand. \"Wait, hold up. You spoke to Bai Xingyue?\"\n\nMo Wudi's empty eyes seemed to suck in all the light in the room. \"I believe I was the last one to see her alive.\"","lastmodified":"2022-04-29T11:35:13.400702706Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/Chapter21-The-Right":{"title":"Chapter 20-The Right","content":"There was a frigid silence as the implications of Mo Wudi's words hit Jiaojiao like one of Dian Zhuo's hammer blows.\n\n*\"I spoke with her, before she drowned in my pond.\"*\n\n*\"I was the last one to see her alive.\"*\n\nJiaojiao smile didn't slip, but the hairs on the back of her neck were standing up like cactus spines. \"I'm not sure what you mean? I am not Bai Xingyue, so I don't recognize you at all--\"\n\n\"I'm the thirteenth prince.\"\n\n*Shit.*\n\n\"You already knew that.\"\n\nJiaojiao shot Guang Qiu an urgent message. *Hello? Are you hearing this? I'm about to die!*\n\nGuang Qiu was apparently offline, because it simply hovered there, unresponsive.\n\nYes. It was now very apparent that Mo Wudi had no intention of letting Jiaojiao go.\n\nHis identity as the thirteenth prince was one of his most closely guarded secrets. In the webnovel, he had killed numerous times to keep his two identities separate, always in cruel, bloody fashion.\n\nWhat Jiaojiao didn't understand was why he was being so open with her.\n\nShe sighed, and poured herself another cup of tea. \"What gave me away?\"\n\n\"You avoided me too eagerly.\"\n\nJiaojiao gave pause, her lips quirking up around her teacup. \"Have you seen yourself lately? If I don't avoid strange men with demon masks then I would be the strange one.\"\n\n\"You avoided my left side in the clinic, even though it would have been a shorter route to the door.\"\n\nIn the webnovel, Mo Wudi had been described as being very guarded against those who approached his left, because of a childhood injury. In one instance, a servant had accidentally bumped his left and lost an arm for it. There was a good reason Jiaojiao had behaved as she had, but it seemed to have backfired.\n\n\"I saw a cockroach on the wall.\"\n\n\"There was no cockroach.\" A pause. \"I would have seen it.\"\n\n\"What is the point of this conversation? Even if I hadn't known you were the thirteenth prince, I certainly know now. What next? Going to kill me to silence me?\"\n\nMo Wudi raised an elegant hand, each joint finely boned, flesh spotless like the porcelain of his mask. He lifted the mask from his face, revealing his facial features.\n\nJiaojiao froze with the teacup halfway to her lips. \n\n\"There's no need to kill you,\" the beautiful idol across from Jiaojiao said, placing the mask down with a faint *tink*.\n\n\"Rank 2. Definitely rank 2,\" Jiaojiao muttered, almost feverishly.\n\n\"What?\" the beautiful face scrunched the tiniest of fractions, causing Jiaojiao undue distress.\n\n\"Don't frown, it will cause wrinkles.\"\n\n\"... as I was saying, there is no need to kill you, but you will tell me who sent you.\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" Jiaojiao said, finally getting her dazzled eyes in order. \"Who sent me? No one *sent* me.\"\n\nShe then paused, remembering the ball, who's server still had not rebooted. *Well, technically...*\n\n\"You're lying,\" Mo Wudi said, deathly calm, but with the promise of violence.\n\n\"I'm not *lying* persay, I'm just not sure how much of the truth you can handle.\"\n\nMo Wudi stared at Jiaojiao, expression not changing a flicker. She wasn't even certain he was breathing. With an atmosphere as fragile as glass, there was only the distant, muffled sound of hammer blows coming from the smithy to denote the passage of time.\n\n\"I will come back when you are ready to talk,\" he said at last, rising with an easily fluidity, like that of a jungle cat. He replaced the mask on his face, then left with barely a displacement of air despite his speed.\n\nJiaojiao hummed in the relaxed silence of his departure. \"What a charming fellow. Very intense.\"\n\nShe didn't doubt that past five minutes were the most dangerous she'd experienced since transmigrating. Not even getting mugged by Tu Wenfeng, with a dagger at her neck had she felt as close to death as she had been in the presence of Mo Wudi's suspicion.\n\n*You need to leave,* Guang Qiu said. *You need to leave right away.*\n\n*Are you finally rebooted?* Jiaojiao asked, perking up.\n\n*There has been a great shift in the plot. You cannot handle what will come next if this goes on. That boy truly means to kill you.*\n\n*Yeah, I already got that message. But how? You think I can outrun that guy? I can't even outrun Granny Chu in this body.*\n\n*Take off the splint.*\n\n*But it hasn't been a week yet.*\n\n*That doctor was just fooling you. The leg was already healed on the second day.*\n\n\"No way. Are you screwing with me?!\"\n\n*I'm sure he was very smug with his trick.*\n\n*And you didn't think to tell me?* Jiaojiao glared.\n\nA wave of petty emotion wafted off the ball.\n\n*All right. It was I who expected too much.* Jiaojiao shook her head and began to pick apart the bandages around her leg. It had been three days and the poor conditions of the temple, especially the mudslinging event, had contributed a layer of grime to the hemp cloth despite her efforts to keep herself clean.\n\nWhen the two lengths of wood clattered to the tea room floor, she bent the stiff muscles experimentally, eyes lighting up when aside from some faint softness in the muscle from disuse, she did not feel any of the pain or discomfort she could expect prior her visit to Doctor Tai.\n\n*All right, I'll admit that poor quack wasn't without skill,* Jiaojiao said, standing with the aid of her staff. She took some hesitant steps toward the door, then stopped.\n\n*How do I get out? I don't know the layout of this place. And how do I avoid being seen?*\n\nThe ball zipped to the front of Jiaojiao and it suddenly hurt Jiaojiao's eyes to look at him, as if someone had nudged the brightness level of their phone to the max. \n\n*What are you doing?* Jiaojiao said, shifting backward. She had gotten used to the ball's lack of initiative, and this sudden display of power left her unsettled.\n\n*It won't last for long. I suggest you make a run for the front door.*\n\nJiaojiao decided the trust the ball, just this once. She opened the sliding door panel carefully, peeking though the crack. When she saw no one in the hallway, she darted out, only slightly favoring her right leg. Carefully closing the door behind her, she made a run for it, only slowing down to turn corners.\n\nWhen she almost ran into a boy dressed like smithy apprentice in the halls, she thought she had been caught, but the boy merely continued to walk toward her. She dodged to the side as he passed and he made no indication he'd seen her. \n\nJiaojiao stared at the ball. *So you're not just a useless lightbulb.*\n\n*Would you move quickly? I can't hold this state for long.*\n\nJiaojiao made it past the front door with no more trouble. She didn't see Mo Wudi, and had no interest in seeing him. She spotted Dian Zhuo laboring at the anvil in the smithy but didn't stop to chat.\n\nWhen she was out the courtyard door, it didn't take long to locate Tu Wenfeng, who was dozing nearby on the side of the street, leaning against his badly repaired rickshaw.\n\nJiaojiao thumped him on the shoulder as she passed. \"I have the money. We need to go.\"\n\nTu Wenfeng shot up as Yanyan herself were beckoning him. His eyes were bright and his cheeks flushed. \"How much?\"\n\n\"Enough. I'll give it to you once you drop me off where we first met.\"\n\nHe frowned. \"You're not going back to the temple?\"\n\nJiaojiao looked at him. \"You want me to go back with you?\"\n\n\"No...\" he stared at the ground. \"Rui Si will miss you.\"\n\nJiaojiao shook her head, and simply sat down in the rickshaw. Tu Wenfeng gave a startled look at her leg. \"It's healed.\"\n\n\"It has *been* healed, apparently,\" Jiaojiao said through gritted teeth.\n\nTu Wenfeng no longer spoke and turned the cart into traffic. Jiaojiao kept a watchful eye on the courtyard door, but no masked demons came darting out to chop her in two.\n\nShe only relaxed when the cart a squeaked a kilometer away. Guang Qiu had become a pale visage of its past self.\n\n*You okay?*\n\n*I expended too much energy. I will be fine in a few days.*\n\nJiaojiao nodded. So she couldn't expect anymore invisibility power-ups. *Got it.*\n\nTu Wenfeng dropped her off on the same road she'd first encountered him. Jiaojiao eased herself off the cart, bouncing on her newly healed leg. She counted out five hundred silver taels in the privacy of her sleeve before handing it over to Tu Wenfeng, wrapped in some cleaner parts of the hemp bandage.\n\n\"Don't spend it all on Yanyan.\" Jiaojiao sneered.\n\nTu Wenfeng's eyes grew shimmery with tears, he bent his head low and splotches of wetness fell to the dusty ground.  His broad shoulders shook with suppressed tremors. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"Yeah, whatever. It's been nice knowing you.\" Jiaojiao waved and turned to leave.\n\n\"Are you sure you won't come back with me?\" Tu Wenfeng called after her. \"Rui Si will cry when she hears.\"\n\nJiaojiao turned her head, a wry smile on her lips. \"You're not an idiot, you probably already know who I am.\" Or at least who this body was. And a girl with as many enemies as her couldn't stay in that place. Who knew what would happen? Mo Wudi alone was enough to raze the place to the ground with a careless flick of his sleeve.\n\nTu Wenfeng turned red. \"We will always welcome you.\"\n\nJiaojiao smirked. \"Who would want to stay in that run-down place anyway?\"\n\nTu Wenfeng bowed low again, a solemn dignity in his movements, and Jiaojiao could almost see the shadow of *Black Wind*. \"Bai Xingyue, we won't forget you. I'm sorry for how we treated you.\"\n\nJiaojiao felt a strange stirring in her chest. She looked down, frowning.\n\n\"Say goodbye to Rui Si for me. She's a smart girl. She won't do badly as long as she remembers my advice.\"\n\nJiaojiao didn't look back again.\n\n*What do we do now?* Guang Qiu fretted. *Mo Wudi won't leave this alone. He knows where you live. He will come after you sooner or later. We have to think of countermeasures--*\n\n\"Hey.\"\n\n*What?! I'm trying to think, mortal, don't interrupt me!*\n\n\"Haven't you thought about it?\"\n\n*Thought about what?* Guang Qiu asked irritably.\n\nJiaojiao walked along the deserted road, appreciating the quiet, the carefree birds darting and singing in the shadows of the trees. A breeze shuffled the leaves, sending a whispering through the stillness. \"Bai Xingyue.\"\n\n*What nonsense are you speaking now?* Guang Qiu grumbled. *She's dead, what of it?*\n\n\"You haven't ever wondered what she would think about all this?\"\n\n*Why would I care?  She's just some lowly mortal.*\n\nJiaojiao stopped and allowed the light and shadow play over her hands, staring at the cracked nails, the purple tint of poison still lingering in her veins.\n\n\"She lived a miserable life, didn't she? I wonder if she had a single happy moment in the fifteen years she lived on this earth.\"\n\nThe misery of Bai Xingyue wasn't something Jiaojiao had taken the time to think about. She hadn't allowed herself to dwell on it. The morality of stealing another person's body, living their life, breathing the air that should have been theirs, was something that would bother her, even if she was vain and selfish. She wasn't a monster after all.\n\n\"You know who would have been a great protagonist?‚Äù\n\n*You aren't speaking sense.*\n\n\"Bai Xingyue.\"\n\n*You--*\n\n\"When Bai Jing didn't show up, why didn't you ever think about resurrecting Bai Xingyue? What was it about me that was so important you'd pass over the most obvious choice? No. It could be argued that Bai Xingyue is the *only* choice.\"\n\nGuang Qiu didn't speak.\n\n\"Who has more right than the original owner of this body? Who more qualified?\" Jiaojiao laughed, mirthless, cold. \"In my opinion, Bai Jing should never come here. If Bai Xingyue couldn't have this life, then no one should have it.\"\n\n*You don't understand,* Guang Qiu said. *You don't understand anything, mortal. Without Bai Jing, the order of this world is in peril. Bai Jing is more worthy of this body than Bai Xingyue--*\n\nJiaojiao gave an angry bark of laughter. \"To say that another person is more worthy of living in this body, than the original owner.\" Jiaojiao looked at the ball. \"What gives you the right? What gives you the fucking right?\"","lastmodified":"2022-04-29T11:35:13.400702706Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/Chapter22-The-Girl-in-the-Fridge":{"title":"Chapter 22-The Girl in the Fridge","content":"How often were characters fridged as ruthlessly as Bai Xingyue? Jiaojiao wondered.  Not only did the poor girl get scarely a mention at all in the book, other than as a waste, a cripple, and an ugly toad who yearned unfittingly after the crown prince? Who was she really? No one knew. No one cared.\n\nBai Xingyue, by all accounts should have led a blessed life. She was born in luxury, status, and with superior body qualities envied in her world. An auspicious cloud hovered over the estate on the day of her birth, heralding that a child of great fortune had been born to the Bai family.\n\nThe empress, in her haste to pair that fortune to her firstborn son, had bestowed an imperial edict ordering the future marriage of the crown prince and the infant, who barely had time to cry out before being doomed to a fate of greatness.\n\nAt least that should have been the case.\n\nIn actuality, Bai Xingyue's misfortune began before she was even born. Her mother, Mu Haoru, was the premiere daughter of the Mu clan, with a stellar upbringing, background, and beauty, she could have had her pick of any of the young men in the capital's noble circle.\n\nHouse Mu's lineage was at least several hundred years older than House Bai, who could be considered something of an upstart. Bai Qinghan, current head of the Bai family, and Bai Xingyue's father, was political rivals with her maternal grandfather, Mu Kangcheng. Prior to Bai Qinghan taking over the reigns, the Bai family idled as minor nobility for generations until the ambitious young Bai Qinghan startled the court with his groundbreaking policies. The emperor was quick to promote such a bright up and coming star to his inner circle.\n\nWho knows what happened, maybe it was *love*, but Mu Haoru‚Äôs critical thinking functions blue screened upon sight of Bai Qinghan‚Äôs chiseled jaw. Despite protests from her mother and her father, she insisted on marrying into the Bai family. Despite having the qualifications to be a main wife of a family of comparable standing to Bai, she insisted on suffering as a concubine. Not to mention Bai Qinghan was at least a decade her senior, but such things mattered little in this world.\n\nBai Qinghan's wife, Zhang Qiuliu was a demure flower with a heart of a viper. Hu Maoxun married into the Bai family with all the pertinent formalities despite her father's protestations. But the day of her marriage was also the last time she would be happy.\n\nIt wasn't eight years later, at the age of twenty-three, that Hu Maoxun died of mysterious causes, With a last *\"I'm sorry, my baby,\"* she passed away one cold winter, leaving the seven year old Bai Xingyue to fend for herself. \n\nBai Xingyue had been heralded as a young prodigy when it was discovered her pure fire element spiritual root was of the rare heaven grade. Unfortunately, after her mother passed, it was discovered she had no way of drawing in spiritual energy.\n\nThis was in actuality, Zhang Qiulu's shenanigans, but for some reason, everyone took this news at face value. Jealousy was a terrible thing.\n\nBai Xingyue's glory ended there. After all, in the noble circle, a girl's qualifications were the most important thing, to ensure that future heirs would carry good genetics and fortune, her imperfections were *unbecoming* of a future empress. Futhermore, she was disfigured by another poison that left an ugly mark on her face. Bai Xingyue's failing health began to make the rounds of the capital, but she *just wouldn't die.*\n\nThe position of future empress was not glory, but a gleaming red target on a little girl's back. Bai Xingyue had no way of protecting herself, and there was no one interested in protecting a little cripple with no prospects. It was a miracle she had lived to be fifteen at all.\n\nThe empress, too embarrassed to retract her edict, could neither stand up or sit down, hovering there awkwardly until Bai Xingyue's coming of age, where she apparently couldn't let the situation go on.\n\nThe drowning incident, Jiaojiao had no doubt was the empress's doing. To frame the thirteenth prince while she was at it was a matter of course. Unfortunately, while Bai Xingyue was truly gone, Jiaojiao was here now, and she had to deal with the mess left behind.\n\n\"Guang Qiu, what is this place?\" Jiaojiao asked, in a rare moment of honest reflection. \"Is this merely a virtual image produced from the ramblings of an author, or a real world?\"\n\n Guang Qiu floated overhead, barely visible in the afternoon light after it's recent expenditure. *You already know the answer to that.*\n\n\"What a garbage world this is,\" Jiaojiao mocked. \"Poor Bai Xingyue. Beyond giving Bai Jing an excuse to behave badly in the name of vengeance, what significance did her existence have at all?\"\n\n*Her fate was sealed the moment she was born,* Guang Qiu said. *She has already passed. Why obsess over her?*\n\n\"Why obsess? I am wearing her body, it would be strange not to care. How can I not wonder what she was like as a person. Isn't it mysterious? She is a ghost in her own family.\"\n\nJiaojiao smiled to herself. \"You seem to idolize Bai Jing, but I think Bai Xingyue is a much more interesting character.\"\n\n*How can you call her interesting when you don't know anything about her at all?*\n\n\"Isn't this precisely why she is interesting? What kind of personality can endure living in that courtyard for fifteen years?\" Jiaojiaos eyelashes shaded her eyes as she looked down. \"I don't doubt that it took a lot of willpower not to end it all. We know nothing about her, but in actuality her story defines Bai Jing's actions. You're not at all curious?\"\n\n*She has a role, but it is not as the main character.*\n\n\"Why though? Why celebrate Bai Jing and denounce Bai Xingyue?\" Jiaojiao laughed. \"Bai Jing might have had the training to do well in a martial world that valued strength, but if Bai Xingyue hadn't had her life cut short, what would she have become, given the time and training? What if she had been given Bai Jing's bracelet, for instance?\"\n\n*This conversation is a waste of time.*\n\n\"She obviously wasn't just some average girl. I think, maybe, she was just waiting. Waiting for an opportunity.\" Jiaojiao shook her head then grimaced. \"I'm hungry. And I need to pee.\"\n\nGuang Qiu hovered behind Jiaojiao as she poked around in the bushes lining the wall with her staff until she found the hole in the wall leading to Hu Maoxun's courtyard. She got down on her knees with far more ease than the last time she'd been there and entered the hole, pushing aside the board covering it to reveal the same sight of the dingy buildings and weed infested garden.\n\n\"Hello?\" Jiaojiao called warily. \"Miss Hu?\"\n\nA white robed figure came into view, visibly frowning. \"B-bai X-xingyue!\"\n\n\"It's me.\"\n\n\"You've been g-gone f-for d-days!\" she whispered. \"T-the es-estate's been in a-an u-uproar! Y-your f-father i-is v-very an-angry!\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\n\"B-bai Xingw-wu has b-been sp-spreading ru-rumors about y-you! Sh-she says y-you,\" Hu Maoxun shaded her mouth with her sleeve. \"That you r-ran o-off with a m-man!\"\n\n\"Well, she's not wrong,\" Jiaojiao said, leaving Hu Maoxun agog.\n\n\"W-what?\"\n\n\"What else has happened?\"\n\n\"N-nothing. I l-let that servant go wh-when y-you didn't c-come back for a wh-whole day,\" Hu Maoxun blinked lip quivering. \"I-I'm s-sorry, sh-she is the o-one who m-made an uproar ab-about your ab-absence.\"\n\n\"Well, you couldn't very well have just left her there. Don't feel bad.\"\n\n\"You g-got y-your l-leg fixed. Th-that's good. J-just. Don't l-let your f-father b-break it a-again. What are y-you going t-to do?\"\n\nJiaojiao held her chin in thought. \"I haven't done anything wrong, but I have a feeling that excuse won't fly with dear old dad.\"\n\n\"H-he is f-furious.\"\n\n\"Well, I'd better face it head on. If it really comes to it, I can just run away again.\"\n\n\"D-did you r-really, r-run away with a m-m-m-man?\" Hu Maoxun twisted her sleeves.\n\n\"Tsk. Why is it that it has to be a man? What if it was a woman?\" Jiaojiao mused. \n\nHu Maoxun's face was full of question marks.\n\n\"Nevermind. You poor sheltered thing. Anyway, countermeasures.\" Jiaojiao held her chin. *Guang Qiu do you have any ideas? I came back here to get away from Mo Wudi, but it seems doesn't seem like this place is much safer. A father that has broken his daughter's leg once is likely to do it again.*\n\nBai Xingyue's crippled leg was simply one in a series of unfortunate events that had happened to her. The author hadn't gone into detail regarding the incident, only describing the event as *\"Bai Xingyue injured her older brother, causing Bai Qinghan to break her leg in anger.\"*\n\nBut what injury could a ten year old girl possibly inflict on her brother then eighteen year old brother? Why devote several thousand words describing Mo Wudi's various attributes and less than two hundred words in total describing Bai Xingyue's past? The book was riddled with holes, and she could only lament she had no way of leaving bad reviews after transmigrating. Though that brought up the question, was the author also from the Earth she knew? Or some other alternate Earth?\n\n*I cannot help you,* Guang Qiu admitted. *You are on your own.*\n\n*Useless.* Jiaojiao shook her head. \"For starters, I cannot let anyone know my leg is healed. It would simply cause more problems.\"\n\n\"T-then?\"\n\nJiaojiao sighed and looked up at the sky. \"I didn't want to have to resort to this, but it looks like I have no choice.\"\n\nHu Maoxun stared, aghast as Jiaojiao leaned her staff against the wall, then lay down on the dusty ground before rolling back and forth. She scraped up a handful of soft dirt and spread it over her face, peppering her cheeks and neck with filth.\n\n\"You mind me borrowing a mirror?\"\n\n\"Y-yes!\" Hu Maoxun scurried away, and returned shortly with a small bronze mirror.\n\nJiaojiao artfully covered her self with dirt and grime, pulling strands of hair out of her neat braid until she looked completely wretched. She studied her reflection a bit more, then pulled cotton cord from her hair entirely before creating an exquisite rat's nest by bunching her hair and back-combing it with a borrowed comb from Hu Maoxun and some sticky gel created from some boiled tree essence.  \n\n\"Perfect.\"\n\n\"Y-you l-look t-terrible.\"\n\n\"Good.\" Jiaojiao dusted off her hands then picked up her staff. \"Thanks for the help. Oh, before I forget.\"\n\nShe fished the correct number of silvers from her sleeve and padded the amount with a bit more before plopping the money into a very confused Hu Maoxun's hands. Jiaojiao sent herself off through the hole in the wall with a careless salute, leaving the baffled and stuttering concubine standing there with her hands full of silver. Ah, it felt good to repay ones debts.\n\n*What do you intend to do now?* Guang Qiu asked. *Will styling yourself a beggar be helpful?*\n\n*You'll see.*\n\nJiaojiao traveled along the road, turning the corner where Tu Wenfeng had dropped her off, and continuing along the main road, following the long, long wall until she located the main entrance of the Bai estate.  By her estimate, it was close to two or three kilometers. Why was this damn place so big?\n\nIt was an austerely decorated set of double doors, complete with Fu dogs, along with a set of stiff-faced doormen in white robes and armor emblazoned with the Bai family standard. \n\nJiaojiao took in a deep breath, looked up at the sky. Tears budding in her eyes, she mustered a fraught expression, as if the world had abandoned her, then edged closer to the door. The two guards regarded her warily, raising their spears to point at her.\n\n\"Is this beggar crazy? What is she doing blocking the gate?\"\n\n\"Just drive her away, don't kill her. Don't dirty the entrance with her blood.\"\n\n*Wow.* Jiaojiao suppressed the urge to roll her eyes. \"Don't you recognize me!?\" she cried, loud enough for the passersby to frown and turn their heads. \"I'm Bai Xingyue! The second young miss of the Bai family!\"\n\nThe two guards stiffened as Jiaojiao took off the straw hat on her head, displaying her red marked face under the stark afternoon sun. One guard whispered to his partner, then darted inside the gates, no doubt to report to someone.\n\n\"Don't you recognize your own master?\" Jiaojiao shouted. The passersby murmured and pointed at her face, whispering among themselves.\n\n\"You...\" the remaining guard said, looking very uncertain at the attention.\n\n\"She's so dirty!\" a woman laughed. \"What happened to her?\"\n\n\"My servant pawned one of my mother's mementos! I went out to get it back but got lost!\" Jiaojiao cried. \"I couldn't find the way back with my bad leg and spent the last few nights at a poor temple! But now these guards won't let me back in my own home!\"\n\n\"She looks so miserable.\"\n\n\"What is the Bai family thinking, letting their own second miss be bullied by her own servant?\"\n\n\"Why haven't I heard anything about the Bai family miss going missing?\"\n\n\"Are you an idiot? Is this something to be advertised? A young unmarried woman wandering the capital streets? What would that do to her reputation? Heh!\"\n\n\"Would a man even want her? Just look at that face....\"\n\n\"I just don't understand why the marriage agreement hasn't been annulled... she is obviously not suitable... what is the Empress thinking?\"\n\n\"Hush! Do you want to lose your head? Is the Empress someone you can mention casually?\"\n\n\"How do you know this is the Bai family miss? What if this is some random beggar?\"\n\n\"Even if it's just the capital waste, it would be too audacious for a beggar to to blacken the family name unless they had a death wish!\"\n\nJiaojiao began to cry even more miserably, her tears drawing stark trails through the dirt on her face. \"My mother's bracelet was pawned by my servant, but I didn't have enough money to buy it back! My allowance was embezzled by her too! All five silvers every month disappears into her purse.\" Jiaojiao wept and wiped her face with a skinny forearm, revealing her sharp elbows, each bone in the joint distinct with malnutrition.\n\n\"Five silvers?\"\n\n\"Heh! The Bai family really knows how to treat their daughters,\" someone sneered. \"I saw Bai Juan just the other day in Golden Peony the other day. She spent five hundred silvers on one dish alone!\"\n\n\"Hiss! The gap is so big?\"\n\n\"One is a genius and the other is a waste. Such a thing is to be expected.\"\n\n\"But this is too much! Look how thin she is.\"\n\nA cold humph sounded from the gate as it was thrown open. A man with a stern jaw flicked his sleeve at Jiaojiao, anger evident in the set of his jaw and his clenched hands.\n\n\"Come inside,\" he said, teeth clenched. \"You still have the face to make a scene at the doors?\"\n\n*Enter Bai Qinghan.* Jiaojiao smirked secretly, outwardly she blinked her dewy eyes, face glistening with tears.\n\n\"F-father d-don't be an-angry,\" she whimpered lurching forward with an exaggerated limp. \"I just d-didn't w-want m-mother's br-bracelet to be lost.\"\n\n\"She is quite filial.\" someone muttered. \"Even with her leg crippled she still limped through the capital to find her mothers' bracelet?\"\n\n\"I-I d-don't m-mind e-even if y-you b-break m-my leg again!\" Jiaojiao cried. \"Just h-help m-me get mother's b-bracelet b-back!\"\n\nIf Bai Qinghan's face was thunderous before, it was now downright apocalytic. \n\n*Mortal, are you trying to get yourself killed?* Guang Qiu said.\n\n*Heh, just get it all out.* Jiaojiao smirked secretly. *Let's see him try to hurt me now.*","lastmodified":"2022-04-29T11:35:13.400702706Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/Chapter23-The-Imperial-Edict":{"title":"Chapter 23-The Imperial Edict","content":"Jiaojiao trailed after Bai Qinghan, the heavy oak doors closing on her staggering heels as she limped after the irate man. He did not speak to her, merely rushing forward through the entryway and the courtyard. Jiaojiao admired the architeture and selection of garden plants, the cleanly swept pathways, blue and gray robed servants watching them wide-eyed, pausing in their duties to ogle them discreetly as they passed.\n\nThe distance between them grew the longer the journey went on, Jiaojiao's exaggerated staggers unable to keep up with Bai Qinghan's long-legged gait.\n\n\"Father, wait for me! she called.\n\nBai Qinghan gave an impatient snort and a guard darted out from an unknown location to sweep her up by the elbows. His face grimaced in disgust at her beggared countenance.\n\nJiaojiao was startled, but managed not to give up the ruse, flailing only briefly before allowing herself to be carried bodily under the arms like a toddler. The guard kept her at arms length, not allowing a single fold of her robe to brush his polished black leather armor.\n\nThe scenery flew by until the guard deposited her on the floor of a study at Bai Qinghan's feet. Jiaojiao looked up into cold, black eyes.\n\nBai Qinghan was a handsome specimen, standing tall at around six feet, towering over Jiaojiao's petite five foot flat. Bai Xingyue after all, wasn't much taller than a child, having been denied proper nutrition for much of her life. Jiaojiao capitalized on this apparent discrepancy, cowering beneath her \"father\"s shadow as he loomed over her, face black like charcoal.\n\n\"What do you think you're doing?\" he said, voice like a dangling icicle.\n\n\"Father,\" Jiaojiao sniffled, \"I'm sorry, I was just worried for mother's bracelet.\"\n\n\"You are a disgrace! Do you know what the capital will be saying about the Bai house after that stunt at the gates? What they will think of us? What they will think of me?\" he thundered his hand rose and fell. A streak of brown energy shot out of his palm, obliterating a nearby tea-table into shards of wood and shattered porcelain. Jiaojiao shielded her face as debris pelted her body.\n\n\"F-father! Please don't be angry!\" Jiaojiao didn't need to fake the tremor in her shoulders this time.\n\n\"I should break your leg again for this insolence!\"\n\n\"Please don't!\"\n\nBai Qinghan raised his hand again. Just as Jiaojiao was certain she would be making another visit to Doctor Tai, the scuffing sound of running footsteps came.\n\n\"Sir!\" a servant bowed low, sleeved hands folded in front of him. \"A messenger has come from the palace!\"\n\nJiaojiao discreetly brushed the shards of wood from her body as Bai Qinghan scowled fiercely at the interruption. \"What do they want?\"\n\n\"They are carrying an imperial edict. They have summoned the Bai family descendants to receive it!\"\n\nBai Qinghan spared Jiaojiao a disgusted glance. \"All of them?\"\n\n\"They said all!\"\n\n\"Very well. See to it that he is properly entertained while the children are summoned. And get this... cleaned.\"\n\nJiaojiao was once again hoisted up and ushered into another room, this time to have the living daylights scrubbed out of her and shoved into a fine silk robe. Her hair was nearly ripped from her scalp as a careless maid tamed it into a neat braid. Jiaojiao should have been happy, all the amenities, the soap was of a fine floral scent and soft like butter, the robe the softest material she'd felt since transmigrating, but the attitudes of the servants attending her were careless and even spiteful.\n\n\"Heh, all that finery, and still ugly,\" one muttered. The rest tittered in response, then escorted her to the main hall where the other Bai children were waiting.\n\nThough to call them children was inaccurate, they were after all all teenaged to adult in years, and all called Bai Qinghan father.\n\nThe Bai family used the naming convention of using the first character of a child's given name the same as all others in their generation, hence every child was named \"*Xing*\" something.\n\nJiaojiao counted off the faces in the hall, trying to put names to them from her knowledge of the text. All of them were tall and beautiful, with sharp, dark eyes like their father.\n\n*How annoying,* Jiaojiao complained. *The poor servants must be on their last braincell, trying not to get them confused.*\n\nBai Xingfei, the eldest male at twenty-five years old, was not present, as he had been long recruited into a reputable sect after displaying extraordinary martial talent. Given his abilities, he was likely to be given an important position in the sect and therefore not suitable for family heir. *Bai Xing Series One,* Jiaojiao thought, ticking off the name in her head.\n\nBai Xing Series Two, or Bai Xingguang, the second eldest at age twenty, also male, was the unofficial family heir. Given that his martial talent was far inferior to his elder brother, he did not have much hope to advance beyond the martial apprentice realm. He gave Jiaojiao a strange look when she came in, scanning her from head to toe and giving her a nasty smirk. Jiaojiao felt an uncomfortable lurch in her stomach as his eyes fell on her and she frowned, holding her middle.\n\nJiaojiao shook her head and moved on to the next in line. Bai Xing Series Three, Bai Xing Juan, eldest daughter. She too was talented at martial arts, having already reached martial master at age sixteen. However, because she was female, she didn't have much hope to travel further on that road without a sect backing her. In the book, she often clashed with Bai Jing, being the number one candidate to replace Bai Xingyue's position as the Crown Prince's fiance.\n\nBai Xing Series Four, was Bai Xingyue, whose body was currently being worn by Jiaojiao. At age fifteen, she should have undergone her hair-pinning ceremony a month ago, however, the day and come and gone without a soul remembering. Jiaojiao sent out a silent prayer to the departed soul, despite being an atheist. As a martial cripple, and literal cripple, she was lowliest of the Bai children and scorned by the entire capital as a waste, especially given her status as the de facto future empress to the realm.\n\nBai Xing Series Five, was Bai Xingwu, the only one Jiaojiao had the pleasure of meeting prior to this summoning. The girl shot an angry glare at Jiaojiao, looking for all the world like she was ready to beat her face in and finish the job she'd abandoned a few days ago. Jiaojiao gave her a tiny wave and a smile before taking her place next to her. The girl gave her a disbelieving look before looking away with a snort. \"Did she become a lunatic as as well as a beggar?\" she mocked under her breath.\n\nThe imperial envoy standing in the center of the hall coughed and opened his mouth to speak when rapid steps came from the double doors. A harried youth hurried in, nodding to the other Bai children, including Jiaojiao become coming to stand beside her. Jiaojiao gave him a strange look. She recognized him as the same boy who had given Hu Maoxun the bag of silvers the day she'd left the estate.\n\n*Who is this?* she asked Guang Qiu.\n\n*He must be a son of the Bai family if he's here for the edict.*\n\n*Well, no shit? Why is there no mention of him in the book?*\n\nGuang Qiu made a humming noise. *He must not have been important enough to mention? So many things have been broken beyond repair since* you've *meddled. After all, this scene happened differently too.*\n\nIn the book, the imperial envoy had come to the estate as well, but it was to annul the marriage between Bai Xingyue and the crown prince. Judging by the line-up, the purpose of this visit was entirely different.\n\nThe envoy gave the boy a questioning glance. \"You are?\"\n\n\"Bai Xingyun,\"\" the boy said. \"This humble one is the third son of Official Bai.\"\n\nThe envoy nodded then unfurled the fine vellum scroll with a flourish. \"To see the imperial edict, is the see the emperor!\"\n\nThe other Bai children fell to their knees. Jiaojiao was a beat too slow and Bai Xingyun gave her a worried look before tugging her down with him by the sleeve.\n\n\"On the third day of the *Kui* month of the Six-hundred-fifty-sixth year of *Meng*... the Royal Hunt is to commence at the Imperial Hunting Grounds. All the younger generation of the Bai family of the ages between thirteen and twenty-five are to attend! Rise to receive the edict!\"\n\nBai Xingguang rose from his one-kneed crouch to receive the scroll with both hands. The envoy gave a standard farewell salute before turning to leave, brushing aside Bai Qinghan's invitations to stay with polite deflections. The two disappeared from view, leaving the Bai children to themselves in the wide hall.\n\n*What are they thinking inviting this cripple to a hunt? Whoever wrote that edict has a bad sense of humor.*\n\nJiaojiao rose from her knees, throwing a bit of side-eye at the boy. If she'd still been a cripple, that tug might have sent her face-planting on the fine goat-hair rug.\n\n\"Humph!\" Bai Xingwu said, similarly rising. \"I'm surprised you have the face to come back! I think you would suit the life of a beggar! After all, that face... really brings ones sympathy!\"\n\nJiaojiao gave Bai Xingwu a polite smile. \"Sister, may I have my mother's bracelet?\"\n\n\"What nonsense are you speaking?\" Bai Xingwu spat.\n\n\"That bracelet on your wrist is my mother's memento. My servant pawned it to the Red Treasure. When I went to get it back, they said the third young miss of the Bai family bought it...\" Jiaojiao gave a delicate pause. \"...forcefully against store policy.\"\n\nBai Xingwu's brows drew up so fast they might have been strapped to rockets. She held slapped her hand to her wrist. \"What?! This is your bracelet?!\"\n\nJiaojiao sniffled. \"Does it disgust you to know I wore it? That it lay against my skin? Aiya, what if... what if you grow a red mark on your face too?\"\n\nBai Xingwu growled and ripped the bracelet from her wrist. \"Disgusting! I will peel the skin from my wrist if I could!\"\n\nJiaojiao held out her hand. \"Sister, will you give me my mother's memento?\"\n\n\"Heh!\" Bai Xingwu's smile grew sharp. \"Even if I don't want it, you're dreaming if you think I'll just give it back!\" With a swish of her pink robes, she turned to leave.\n\nJiaojiao limped after her, calling, \"Third Sister! Wait!\"\n\nThe other children watched the event without intervening. Bai Jing's eyes bored, while Bai Xingguang had a strange, twisted expression on his lips. Jiaojiao's stomach gave another lurch as she caught sight of it.\n\nBai Xingwu stopped next to a lotus pond. She waited until Jiaojiao caught up to her before flashing a brilliant grin. Her face was light and airy with joy. The golden wood bracelet lay on the girl's white palm, exquisite and delicate carvings of lifelike flowers and greenery shimmered in the sunlight..\n\n\"You want the bracelet?\" she said sweetly. \"Then you can swim for it!\"\n\nThe bracelet disappeared with a plop into the waters, with scarely a ripple. Bai Xingwu gave a sweet laugh before sauntering away.\n\n*Now what?* Jiaojiao thought, looking down at the green waters of the lotus pond. *I know how to swim, but I'd be an idiot to try in broad daylight.*\n\n\"I can help you get it,\" said a voice. Jiaojiao turned to see Bai Xingyun, the same boy that had tugged her to the ground in the hall.\n\nJiaojiao stared at the boy in thought. *Guang Qiu, did Bai Xingyue know this boy?*\n\n*How should I know?*\n\n\"Why would you help me?\" Jiaojiao asked.\n\nThe boy shrugged and kicked off his cloth shoes, rolling up his sleeves and pant-legs, and tucking his robes into his belt.\n\nHe didn't answer Jiaojiao, simply wading into the pond with a splash. It wasn't very deep, scarcely above his knees, but the ends of his robes still ended up soaked despite his precautions.\n\nHe looked for all the world like a peasant wading in a rice paddy, despite his fine robes and polished bone hair pin, stark and brilliant against his ink hair.\n\nJiaojiao sat in the shade of a nearby pear tree as she waited for the boy to finish his quest. His eyes lit up a few minutes later, his hands coming out of the water with the bracelet and a handful of soft, yellow mud. He thoughtfully washed the bracelet before handing it back to Jiaojiao with a sheepish smile.\n\n\"Bai Xingyue,\" said a male voice in a peculiar tone.\n\nThe two by the pond looked up from their exchange to see Bai Xingguang standing on the path. His face bright with delight in the setting sun as he tapped the vellum scroll against his neck. Unwittingly, the day had passed.\n\nJiaojiao stood slowly as the young man strolled closer. Bai Xingyun stepped forward to intercept Bai Xingguang.\n\n\"Brother.\"\n\n\"Have you taken a liking to the little cripple?\" asked Bai Xingguang with a laugh. \"Though, I suppose two cripples would have a lot to talk about.\"\n\nBai Xingyun bowed his head and cupped his hands. \"Brother, please don't be like this.\"\n\nBai Xingguang strolled around Bai Xingyun, shoulder checking the teenager hard enough to make him stumble. \"Know your place, servant. You may have the blood of the Bai family in you, but your lowly blood can't be washed out.\"\n\nJiaojiao's heart started a frenetic, pace in her chest. Her breath came in short gasps as Bai Xingguang came close enough to breathe on her, hand coming up to pinch her chin, hard enough to bruise.\n\n\"Sister.\"\n\nJiaojiao clutched her chest with a shaking hand, soundless words came and went, leaving aborted gasps to puff out of her trembling lips. What was happening with her? Why was her body...\n\nBai Xingguang laughed, low and suggestive. He withdrew his hand and turned away, leaving only the lingering trace of myrrh and incense.\n\n\"Bai Xingyue, are you hurt?\"\n\nJiaojiao couldn't speak. She couldn't breathe. Her heart a malfunctioning engine running too fast.\n\nThe teenaged boy took her by the sleeve and tugged her away from the pond. Jiaojiao caught sight of his worried eyes, but couldn't resist, barely able to think. She was led down a meandering path, the dying sun threw stark shadows, confused and myriad. Hushed voices whispered as they passed.\n\n*What's happening?* she asked Guang Qiu, her minds voice sounded like it passed through several distortion filters.\n\nThe ball didn't answer. It couldn't even be seen hovering nearby. When had it left?\n\nThe next Jiaojiao knew, she was in a courtyard, both familiar and strange in the low, crimson light.\n\n\"Aiya!\" came the high voice of an old woman. \"Yueyue! You're back!\"\n\nJiaojiao started, shook her head, confused shapes still dogging her mind. \"Don't leave me here with her,\" she whispered.\n\nThe boy frowned, but still let go of her sleeve. \"You'll be fine,\" he said, before leaving her with a head like a raging monsoon. Invisible winds seemed to lash at her from the inside as she watched, dazed, the old woman come closer and take her by the hand.\n\n\"Nanny Cen,\" Jiaojiao rasped, eyes like fog.\n\n\"Yueyue, I missed you,\" the old woman said with tears in her eyes. \"You're finally home.\"","lastmodified":"2022-04-29T11:35:13.400702706Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/Chapter24-The-Guilt-of-Bai-Xingyue":{"title":"Chapter 24-The Guild of Bai Xingyue","content":"---\n\n*A beautiful little girl wanders into a large hall, a rattle drum held in one hand. Her soft red robe bounces with each step. A tall man stands next to a slender woman.*\n\n*\"Father! Mother!\" the little girl says, running to the two. *\n\n*The man laughs and scoops her up in his arms. \"Yue'er, don't run! What if you fall?\"*\n\n*The woman smiles and reaches up to touch the girls cheek. \"Yueyue is getting taller every day.\"*\n\n*The girl is a little taller. She shyly hands a white peony blossom to a young boy wearing a golden hair crown. The boy bows and takes it. *\n\n*The girl is taller still, she kneels worriedly at the side of a bed. A pale woman lies there, sweaty, glassy eyes. She places a trembling hand on the girl's head, eyes looking past her.*\n\n*\"Baby, mother is sorry she couldn't save you.\"*\n\n*The girl is dressed in white, her eyes red as they carry a coffin into a stone tomb set into the side of a misty hill. The tall man has his head bowed. He reaches over and takes the young girl by the hand.*\n\n*The young girl hides in the shadows as the tall man listens to another man say. \"I'm very sorry Official Bai, the girl has withered meridians. She has no way of cultivating in this lifetime.\"*\n\n*The girl is strapped to a wide table. They cut her open. She screams but they don't* stop.\n\n*A teenager with the same face as the tall man lies on a neighboring table, his eyes bright.*\n\n*The girl sits in a waterside pavilion. She has grown taller again, but there is no smile on her face. She is thin. Pale. *\n\n*A teenager strolls into the pagoda. He reaches for the girl's braids. \"Little sister, you look lovely today.\"*\n\n*The scene is engulfed with white flame.*\n\n*The girl lies, pain wracked on a bed. Blood flows from her broken leg, shards of bone protruding from the skin.*\n\n*An old woman comes and wipes the sweat from her brow. \"Endure it Yueyue.\"*\n\n*\"Where is the doctor?\" the girl rasps.*\n\n*There is no answer.*\n\n*A girl sits in front of a mirror. Her beautiful face is marked with a red dot the size of a cherry blossom. The old woman clucks in worry next to her. \"I just don't know what has happened to your face! Don't worry Yueyue, I'm sure it's will disappear on it's own.\"*\n\n*A girl sits in a lonely courtyard, her face obscured with red. A second girl comes. She is full of sharp words and anger. *\n\n*The years roll by like a picture scroll. Each more empty and lonely than the last. She no longer has her beauty or her happiness.*\n\n*\"You are so disgusting.\" *\n\n*\"So ugly!\" *\n\n*\"You slut.\"*\n\n*\"You got what you deserved.\"*\n\n*The girl looks up as a beautiful girl in white offers her hand. \"Sister, won't you come with me to the imperial banquet?\"*\n\n*The girl is drowning. She reaches for the girl in white, but she stands by coldly as the girl flails in the water.*\n\n*I see. This is where it ends.*\n\n*The girl stops struggling and lets the water close over her. The girl in white says something, but the words are lost in the silent world. A thin film separates them, but they are in separate worlds, as they have always been.*\n\n*Why. Why. Why. Why. Why.*\n\n*WHY?*\n\nThe scene evaporates like smoke.\n\nJiaojiao woke, gasping for air. She clutched at her head.\n\n*Jiaojiao? Who is Jiaojiao?*\n\n*I am Bai Xingyue. Third daughter of the Bai family.*\n\n\"No. I'm not!\" Jiaojiao punched herself in the temple. \"Get the fuck out!\"\n\nThe voices and shapes in her head did not disappear. Jiaojiao stood shakily, flinging aside the moth-eaten covers. She staggered past the broken door, the worn furniture, the dusty cobwebs. A full moon hung over the gloomy courtyard. A night creature called out before falling silent abruptly, its cry was cut short. Jiaojiao let the moonlight wash over her.\n\n*It's all your fault.*\n\n*It's not! I'm not you!*\n\n*You know what you need to do.*\n\nThe girl gave a grunt of frustration and went back inside. She kicked the low tea-table upside down and worked a leg free from the carcass. She took the make-shift club and came to Cen Wei's door. \n\nMoonlight flooded the room as the girl eased the door open. The woman didn't stir when the girl came to the head of her kang and brought the table leg down on her head, groaning when the girl tied her down to the four posts of her bed.\n\nThe girl lit an old lantern and brought it close to the woman's head. She stared at the woman's face for a long long time, then turned to rummage in the surroundings. The girl found the secret compartment in her wardrobe and unearthed a fist-sized bag of powder. She dumped it into the pitcher of water on the servant's table and stirred.\n\nCen Wei coughed and gagged as the girl pinched her mouth open and carefully poured the liquid mixture into her mouth, eyes flat, expression grim.\n\n\"Awake?\" the girl asked the old woman.\n\n\"W-what did you feed me?\"\n\n\"I found it in your wardrobe. You should know better than me what it is.\"\n\nThe woman's eyes nearly popped out of their sockets. She coughed and retched, trying to vomit out the contents of her stomach. The girl observed her antics.\n\n\"Can't even stand a single taste? I ate it everyday for eight years.\"\n\n\"Yueyue! Untie me right now!\" The old woman screamed.\n\nYueyue cocked her head, then brought the club down on the woman's leg. Once. Twice. Thrice.\n\nThe old woman howled as her bones, brittle with age snapped under the girl's continued onslaught. Not satisfied, the girl repeated her actions with the other leg.\n\n\"I'll kill you!\" the old woman screeched through her wails of pain. \"You little whore! I'll kill you!\"\n\nAnother club to the woman's cheek had her curses cut short.\n\n\"Servant, know your place.\"\n\nThe old woman's eyes were bloodshot with rage, but she bit back her words. \"Yueyue, why are you doing this?\"\n\n\"How long will you play dumb? Did you really think I didn't know what you were doing all those years?\"\n\nThe old woman chewed on her lip. \"You knew you were being poisoned?\"\n\n\"I knew. I knew you were working for the Mu family too. I also know that my mother asked you to poison me.\"\n\nA frigid silence.\n\n\"I just don't understand why.\" The girls' eyes grew faint with confusion and hurt. \"Why did she do that to me?\"\n\n\"Hah! You understand nothing!\" the old woman spat. \"You are a sinner! You deserve everything that happened to you!\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"You really think you are Haoru's daughter? You look nothing like her! You look nothing like your so-called father!\" Cen Wei laughed. \"If that ugly thing on your face wasn't there, it would be obvious to all that you're a bastard!\"\n\nThe girl held her head. \"I'm not...\"\n\n\"You are! You're some wild seed dropped on Haoru's doorstep! And your real parents,\" the old servant hawked a glob of phlegm and spat it at the girl. \"They are murderers!\"\n\n\"You're lying.\"\n\n\"I can still lie about this? The day... \" the servant's eyes grew misty. \"I saw it. A man snuck into young miss‚Äôs room. He touched her stomach as she lay sleeping and the next day she went into labor! Flame colored auspicious clouds rose above the estate, but the baby was stillborn.\" Cen Wei's eyes grew fearful as she recalled. \"He walked among the servants, but it was as if no one could see him. He placed you in her arms and it was as if she had forgotten the dead baby at her side.\"\n\nCen Wei's eyes grew fierce. \"He tried to trick me too, but he was injured. He couldn't make me forget.\" She laughed, high-pitched, manic. \"He placed the dead baby in my arms and told me to bury it. He left something for you too. He told me to give it to you when you came of age. But I threw it away! You'll never find it!\"\n\nThe girl gave a sharp cry of pain, and knelt, hands holding her face.\n\n\"You‚Äôre nothing but a cuckoo occupying the magpies nest. You're not your mothers' daughter at all. You're nothing but the daughter of the murderer that killed her baby. Hah, you're lucky she even kept you for seven years. She should have strangled you the moment I told her the truth!\"\n\n\nThe girl looked up, but the set of her shoulders, her eyes, and most of all, her expression were as different as  night and day. \n\n\"Are you done?\" Jiaojiao rose, smacking the club against her free hand. \"I don't mind hitting you a few more times if it will help you keep a civil tongue.\"\n\nCen Wei glared, but gulped as she looked at the table leg. \"What do you want to do?\"\n\n\"What did you do with the thing that that man wanted you to give her--uh, me?\"\n\n\"I threw it away!\"\n\nJiaojiao smacked the club lightly on the servant's broken legs. The old woman screeched and drew back as far as she could with her arms and legs tied.\n\n\"Fine fine! I buried it with the dead baby!\"\n\n\"Where did you bury it?\"\n\n\"Under the peach tree in the old courtyard!\"\n\n\"There's no peach tree here.\"\n\n\"Not this place. Haoru's old courtyard,\" she gave Jiaojiao a peculiar look. \"You should remember it. You were very happy in those times.\"\n\nJiaojiao couldn't remember, but Bai Xingyue could. She rubbed her aching brows, a massive migraine pounding away in her temples. \"Uh huh, very happy. I'm glad we had this talk.\" A cold smile crept onto her face. \"Really glad.\"\n\n\"What... what will you do with me?\" Cen Wei said in a hushed voice, staring at Jiaojiao as if she were a stranger.\n\n\"Now you know fear?\"\n\n\"Don't kill me, I can help you!\"\n\n\"Help me how? Help me the same way you helped me these past years?\" Jiaojiao knelt on the bed with a laugh and swished the remaining liquid in the pitcher. \"Drink the rest of the water and I won't kill you.\"\n\nThe woman nodded frantically. Jiaojiao poured the rest of the murky water into her mouth, watching dispassionately to make sure the old woman didn't spit it out.\n\nShe waved a hand and blew out the lantern, casting the room into darkness save for the stream of moonlight in the doorway. \n\n\"I'll leave you alive for now. Try not to make too much noise. Who knows if might come back to finish the job I started.\"\n\nWith a last look, Jiaojiao shut the door on the fearful servant. She walked back to her own room with a daze and sat there in the dark, not bothering to light a candle or lantern.\n\n\"Come out. I know you're there.\"\n\nWhen there was only silence, Jiaojiao slammed a palm on the kang. \"Get out right now, or I'm drowning myself in the nearest pond!\"\n\nA dim ball of light popped into view directly above her. Jiaojiao gave it a mirthless laugh. \"You fucker. You really dared...\"\n\n*I had no choice,* the ball said, sounding almost apologetic. *I looked at the fate-lines. This was the only way to get you to follow--*\n\n\"By fucking with my memories?!\" Jiaojiao threw the porcelain pillow at the ball. It passed harmlessly through it to crash into the wall, breaking in two.\n\n*Your memories are intact, I merely repaired the damaged areas in your brain so you would recover the body's existing memory.*\n\n\"You make it sound like you did nothing!\"\n\n*Why are you are so angry?* The ball asked, genuinely baffled, *You weren't even this angry when I brought you to this place or when I threatened to kill you...*\n\n\"This is worse, this is far worse.\" Jiaojiao held her aching head. \"You've fucking given me multiple personality disorder. You utter **shluha vokzal‚Äônaja**! [^1]\" \n\n*What... what does that mean?*\n\n\"You know what, don't talk to me. Just shut up. Shut up for the rest of eternity.\"\n\n*You can't expect me to--*\n\nJiaojiao shut her eyes and lay back on the bed, folding her hands across her chest. \"Just shut your whore mouth for once in your life, Guang Qiu.\"\n\n*You--*\n\nGuang Qiu paused in astonishment.\n\nOne second they were no in a the dilapidated room of Bai Xingyue, and then next...\n\nThey were in a wide open hall, white stone walls enclosed all sides, but the roof was split open to a cerulean sky. Fluffy clouds drifted playfully on the wind. \n\n Sunlight lanced through wide latticed windows with complex geometric patterns, casting dazzling shadows on the elaborate mosaic tiled floors. Ivy crept over the wide sill, spilling greenery onto the walls and floors. \n\nA tall girl with perfectly styled brown hair stood in the center of the hall, she gazed at the sunlight playing over her hands, holding her elaborately decorated nails to the light.\n\nGuang Qiu buzzed in alarm. *You--you!!*\n\n\"What is it Guang Qiu?\" Jiaojiao said with a tsk. \"You look like you've seen a ghost.\"","lastmodified":"2022-04-29T11:35:13.400702706Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/Chapter25-The-Broken-Castle":{"title":"Chapter 25-The Broken Castle","content":"Guang Qiu professed that it didn't have a good understanding of the mortal he'd personally stolen from that minor realm. At the beginning, it had merely been concerned with the vacancy left behind the heroine of his chosen assignment and hadn't considered too much when picking up the nearest replacement with sufficient *ming*. After all, what difference did one mortal have from the next? Surely, the gap wouldn't be *too* big.\n\nMortals were simple creatures. They lusted for life, for wealth, for power. If he pulled on the right strings, made the right threats, it wouldn't be hard to get the creature to dance the way he needed it to.\n\nAt least, that *had* been the plan.\n\n*What... what is this place?* Guang Qiu asked the girl in the middle of the shattered hall.\n\n\"You want to know?\"\n\n*I--*\n\n\"Then I won't tell you.\"\n\n*MORTAL!!*\n\nThe girl patted her ear, careful not to get her long nails tangled with her hair. \"Could you keep it down? The echo in here is pretty significant.\"\n\n*How? Why?*\n\n\"I bet you're curious. I bet you're *dying* to know what's going on.\"\n\n*Well--I--*\n\n\"Yeah, I think I like it when you're confused. You're cuter this way.\" \n\nThe girl kicked aside a half crumbled brick, and strolled down one of the many corridors branching from the cavernous hall. Sunlight, soft and luminous, brushed the tips of her long curled eyelashes as she passed the latticed windows. A sapphire blue bird alighted on the sill of a window before darting away at her approach.\n\nGuang Qiu drifted after Jiaojiao, it's mind blank and fuzzy like cotton. The tall ceilings were three times the height of the girl, dwarfing her figure, and yet she seemed the undisputed master of this mysterious realm. The light seemed to gather on her form like specks of glitter, shrouding her in a gauzy cocoon.\n\nIt seemed a minute, it seemed like ten. It also seemed like time had stopped. The form of a girl and the ball wandered through the branching halls, passing half collapsed walls, and empty rooms, full of dust and an indistinct melancholia.\n\nThere were many barred stone doorways, some set with cloudy gems, their facets hidden under dust and time. Guang Qiu attempted to enter one of these closed rooms, only to be bounced back by an unseen force. Jiaojiao merely gave it a sarcastic look at this behavior.\n\nFinally, they came to a grand doorway, carved grandly with abstract, curling shapes and unknown glyphs. Jiaojiao placed a hand on the carved white handle. \n\n\"It's been a long time,\" Jiaojiao said, brushing her hand over the dusty stone. After a long hesitance, she tried to pull the door open, but it didn't budge at all. She bowed her head a long moment before straightening, dusting off her hands.\n\n*What is this place?* the ball asked again, this time in a hushed, hesitant voice.\n\nJiaojiao didn't answer. They wandered again for a time. This time, Jiaojiao's footsteps becoming more and more urgent, as if she sensed she was closing in on her destination.\n\n\"There it is, thank fuck,\" she muttered.\n\nThey had exited the labyrinthian palace and entered a courtyard with distinctly separate architecture. Guang Qiu buzzed, high and excited.\n\n*Isn't this?!*\n\n\"Recognize it? You should. You put it here, after all,\" Jiaojiao said, low and angry.\n\nA facsimile of Bai Xingyue's courtyard lay in a stretch of crumbled stone, as if a meteorite had crashed into a section of the ruined white palace and lodged itself there. \n\nJiaojiao stepped warily past the moon door, sneering at the familiar layout, rolling here eyes at the sight of the dreaded outhouse. \"It really clashes with the locale, I should have you shot for what you've done to my palace.\"\n\n*Your palace?!* Guang Qiu said. *This place is yours?*\n\n\"Who the fuck else, genius?\"\n\nJiaojiao shook her head, then flicked out her hand, her bedazzled nails flashing in the light. The ground beneath her began to shake, as a sleeping giant were trying to rattle itself free from its prison.\n\n*What... what are you doing?*\n\n \"This place doesn't belong here, of course I'm getting rid of it!\"\n\nGuang Qiu's form flashed, dazzling and bright in agitation. *If this place is a result of... you... you're trying to get rid of the Bai Xingyue's memories?!*\n\n\"Idiot, even you should understand why I don't want them in my head!\" Jiaojiao's eye's showed lines of strain around the corners as her other hand came out to join the first. \n\n*...how are you doing all this?*\n\nJiaojiao gave the ball a ridiculing look. \"You refuse to tell me anything and think I've going to give you my secrets? How the fuck does that work?\"\n\nOkay, Guang Qiu had to admit the mortal had a point.\n\n*You can't do it!* The ball said after a long strained silence. *I admit you have some hidden talent, but it won't be that easy to get rid of Bai Xingyue's spiritual presence. This place, is likely a spiritual construct of your consciousness. I'm surprised you can manifest one so realistic with no cultivation and no formal training, but that's the limit of your ability!*\n\n\"Just watch me.\"\n\nAs if to punctuate her point, the corners of the courtyard walls began to fold in on themselves like they were being torn out from a picture scroll. Guang Qiu blared in alarm as the roof shingles began to lift up and shatter into motes of light, disappearing into the sunlight as if like melting snow.\n\n*Don't do this! I realize you're angry, but these memories are important! They are the key to returning destiny to the right path!*\n\n\"How many times do I have to tell you?\" Jiaojiao forced out between gritted teeth. \"I don't have any interest in destiny!\"\n\n*Why not? Don't you want the power to do great things?* Guang Qiu scrambled for convincing points. *Don't you want to remembered by history?*\n\n\"Not me.\"\n\nWith a scream of stone and shattered pottery, half of Bai Xingyue's residence caved in. Guang Qiu was nearly driven to despair when suddenly, all movement stopped.\n\nJiaojiao froze, her hair lifting in an invisible current. The door to Bai Xingyue's residence swung open. A familiar face appeared in the doorway, thin, terrible. Hobbling footsteps sounded, and a short, thin figure appeared, her tattered robes floating on a phantom breeze.\n\nJiaojiao's face, always so composed, was drawn in a rictus of horror as the girl with the marred face stepped into the light, her very form at odds with Jiaojiao's seemed to suck in all the color of the surroundings, leaving a dull monochrome in her shambling wake.\n\nEven Guang Qiu, a being beyond life and death, found shivers crawling up it's non-existent body. \n\nThe two, as if two insects pinned to a board, were unable to move or speak as the spectre limped toward them, expression hidden under a curtain of dark hair.\n\nAt last, the ghost of Bai Xingyue stopped in front of Jiaojiao. The curtain of lanky hair fell away from her face, revealing eyes like an abyss, half her face swept by an ugly red mark. The girl, a full foot shorter than Jiaojiao reached out with a corpse-pale hand and gripped Jiaojiao's outstretched hand.\n\nEverything snapped back into place, like a page had been turned in a book. The courtyard returned to its former appearance, shabby and worn, but intact.\n\nThe girl sat up in the *kang* with a gasp. Her former beauty, the scenery with the white palace,  disappeared like a figment of the imagination.\n\n*What. How?* Guang Qiu reeled in confusion.\n\nLow laughter sounded in the eerie darknesss\n\n\"Isn't this exactly what you wanted?\" came a strange voice. Thin, pinched, uncertain.\n\n*...which one are you?*\n\n\"I'm not sure I know myself.\"\n\nThere came a confused sound, halfway between a laugh and a sob.\n\nThe night passed in a strange blur. Guang Qiu felt some strange disturbance within itself as it listened to the girl weeping and laughing in the dark.\n\nGuang Qiu didn't feel guilt. It was far too old, too accustomed to playing with the lives under his purview. It's job just didn't allow for such emotions.\n\nBut just this once. It doubted.","lastmodified":"2022-04-29T11:35:13.400702706Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/Chapter26-Certifiable":{"title":"Chapter 26-Certifiable","content":"---\n\nDawn emerged, hesitant on this morning. A girl lay on the kang, doused in a sullen gray light through a mottled patchwork of rags and paper on the window frame. She had grown quiet hours ago, tears leaving not a trace on her face. Her eyes were blank, depths awash with unknown thoughts.\n\n*Mortal?* Guang Qiu called out, uncertain. *You've not gone crazy, have you?*\n\nThe girl did not respond for a long time. Finally, her eyes twitched the slightest bit before landing on the ball. \"Crazy? That's a mild term for how I'm feeling right now. I'm fucking certifiable.\"\n\n*You... you seem rather lucid?*\n\n\"For now, you glorified pixie. Who knows when the next psychotic break is coming, JFC.\"\n\n*You yourself said that Bai Xingyue is the best candidate for Bai Jing's replacement,* Guang Qiu said. *I put some thought into it and think you're right.*\n\n\"Oh my fucking god,\" Jiaojiao rubbed her eyes furiously. \"Don't tell me this whole fiasco is because of what I told you? My god. Did I screw myself? Good bye Jiaojiao, hello darkness my old friend. *What the fuck. Guang Qiu, yobanaya suka.*\" [^1]\n\n*It's obvious, you lack... motivation.*\n\n\"You thought giving me schizophrenia would change that? Brilliant, excellent, you must be the star employee at Isekai Incorporated.\"\n\n*I actually have a perfect track record! And far be it for a puny mortal to get in the way of that!* Guang Qiu hummed.\n\nJiaojiao was too worn out to argue. She'd spent the last five hours trying to put a lid of the geyser of negative emotions Bai Xingyue's memories had injected into her psyche. \n\nIt was a strange sensation, to have another person's memories shoe-horned into your head. She could suddenly recall two separate lifetimes worth of memories, and the edges where they touched was also the fraying edges of her sanity, as if these two incompatible substances were scraping, rubbing, wearing away at each other.\n\nWas she Jiaojiao with Bai Xingyue's memories or was she Bai Xingyue with Jiaojiao's memories?\n\nJiaojiao paused, hand once again going to her forehead. The insistent negative emotions, pound, pound, pounding away at her patience.\n\nShe had wondered what Bai Xingyue was like as a person, now she knew.\n\nBai Xingyue was... angry.\n\nVery, very angry.\n\nAnd she had every right to be.\n\n*Mortal!*\n\n\"What?\" Jiaojiao snapped.\n\n*...I called you at least ten times, how dare you ignore me?*\n\n\"Are we still on speaking terms? After what you did to me?\"\n\n*Mortal! I've proven that I'm not without ways to discipline you! If you don't behave--*\n\n\"Or what? Will you make me even crazier? Yeet into another universe? Maybe this time the stone age? *Kooshay govno sooka!* [^2] *Jri govno i zdohni!* [^3]\"\n\nGuang Qiu buzzed in affront. *Don't think I don't know what you're saying, mortal! I'm well versed in languages! It's easy to see you're insulting me!*\n\nJiaojiao clapped sarcastically.\n\n*Enough! Don't we have more important things to do? Take out the artifact!*\n\nJiaojiao paused, then patted her sleeves. fishing out the golden wood bracelet. She stared at it.\n\n*Good good! Now cut your hand and place a drop of your blood--*\n\nJiaojiao flung it across the room.\n\n*Mortal!*\n\n\"Get bent, you dumb fairy bitch.\"\n\n*Are you insane?! That artifact is priceless!*\n\nJiaojiao really did feel a bout of insane laughter coming on.  She snickered into her fist.\n\n*Go pick it up! What are you waiting for?*\n\nJiaojiao did not pick it up. She stood and flounced outside, a calm smile on her face. \"Guang Qiu, you've been with me for a few days now. Surely you have some inkling of what kind of person I am?\"\n\n*Mortal!*\n\n\"Have I ever responded well to threats, insults or ultimatums?\"\n\n*Come back here!*\n\n\"Have I ever give you the idea that I'm interested in your little games of fate?\"\n\n*Mortal! Don't make me angry!*\n\n\"Guang Qiu, you're a real idiot,\" Jiaojiao gave the ball a wan smile. \"You've just gone and trounced on my last nerve.\"\n\nJiaojiao ran into Hu Maoxun's courtyard, the concubine barely had the time to say hello before Jiaojiao was diving through the hole in the wall. Ten minutes later Jiaojiao was standing by the side of a busy road, watching the horse-drawn carts flying past, uncaring of the people whispering and pointing at her red-marked face. \n\n*What are you doing mortal? Why are you here making a spectacle of yourself.*\n\n\"I'm giving it a test.\"\n\n*...giving what a test?* Guang Qiu asked, a thread of unease clearly making its way into it's voice. *What are you really doing here?*\n\n\"I'm going to see, how powerful destiny can be. For instance,\" Jiaojiao took a step off the side-path and into the main thorough-way. \"What happens if the main character doesn't want to play anymore?\"\n\nWith a last hop and step, Jiaojiao stepped directly into the path of a rushing carriage. The coachman yelled and drew back on the reins, but it was no use. The horses were far too fast. By the time they stopped, Jiaojiao would be a pancake with no more worries.\n\nJiaojiao gave the ball a manic smile. \"Well? Do something. Aren't you very powerful?\"\n\n*Mortal! Look out!*\n\nJiaojiao was looking, every detail of the oncoming cart etched into her memory. The coachman's startled face, the flaring nostrils of the horses, annoyed at the sudden wrenching on their reigns. The first time she died, she hadn't felt any pain. It would be a lie to say she wasn't afraid, but the greater underlying emotion was elation. Elation and anger. \n\nA great monstrous anger.\n\nJiaojiao felt dizzy all of a sudden. A surge of fear overcame her. She frowned at held her head. *What's happening? Why am I behaving this way?*\n\n*Death? I would never--*\n\nThe horses hooves were close enough to touch her robe. As if in slow motion, she saw the metal shoes glinting in the gloomy morning light. She saw the individual veins in the eyes of the horses, the wide open mouth of the panicked driver. She even thought she could count the drops of spittle flying from his mouth, shouting at her to *move.*\n\nA warm body suddenly slammed into her. Time resumed its normal pace. The roll of the carts wheels passed inches from her face.\n\n\"You stupid beggar! Get out of the way!\" the driver was yelling.\n\n\"Are you alright?\" A fearful voice said, a hand pulling her up from the dusty road. \"Why were you standing in the road?\"\n\nJiaojiao looked up into Bai Xingyun's frowning face. Still reeling from the near-miss, she felt her pounding heart with a trembling hand. Adrenaline stealing the breath from her lungs.\n\n\"Are you hurt anywhere?\" the boy was asking.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" Jiaojiao asked between pants, head between her knees.\n\n\"I... saw you crawl through the wall,\" Bai Xingyun said, a strange blush on his cheeks. \"I was curious.\"\n\n\"You followed me?\"\n\n\"Should... should I not have?\" the boy asked. \"I was worried about you.\"\n\n\"I don't even know you.\"\n\nJiaojiao knew for sure now that this boy had nothing to do with Bai Xingyue. After all, the girl's memories only had the vaguest impression of this shadow son of the Bai family. Before yestereday, he hadn't even spoken to \"Bai Xingyue\" So why was he so invested in her well-being?\n\nWhat was he really after?\n\nJiaojiao distanced herself from the teenager, brows drawn in fatigue and confusion. She didn't even know herself right now, she wasn't in any condition to question the why and how of this boy's sudden interest in her.\n\n\"Stay away from me.\"\n\nJiaojiao wandered in a near fugue state, making her way back to the Bai estate. She vaguely sensed Bai Xingyun following her a few paces behind.\n\nWhen she had crawled back through the hole in the wall, traveled past a puzzled Hu Maoxun to find her way back to her courtyard, Jiaojiao once again found herself sitting on the kang. For a moment she doubted she had ever left. Perhaps she had imagined the whole incident.\n\n*Suicidal? Me?*\n\nJiaojiao knew herself well. If there had ever been a point in her life where she might have taken her own life it would have been--\n\nAnyway. It wouldn't have been now. In this place. These feeling weren't hers. They weren't even Bai Xingyue's she didn't think. If anything, it was the conflict between their two warring personalities that was causing this... dysfunction.\n\n\"Guang Qiu, you've cocked it up,\" Jiaojiao groaned. \"You've really gone and done it.\"\n\n*Mortal?* Guang Qiu called, tentative, as if Jiaojiao were fragile to the point of bashing her brains out on the nearest pillar. *Are you feeling better?*\n\n\"What do you think, genius? I almost went and got myself trampled. God, what a way to go.\"\n\nIf she could rate the ways she wanted to die, her original way of death was perfect. No muss, no fuss, and her body was in perfect condition. Getting trampled to death by horses would rate at the other end of the spectrum, along with death by fire, or getting melted by acid.\n\nIt was *messy.*\n\nAnd she hated mess.\n\n\"You're a *hooy morzhovy*.\" [^4]\n\n\"Who are you talking to?\"\n\nJiaojiao froze for a good ten seconds, before her head turned creakily, as if on a rusted hinge, toward the source of the voice.\n\nA young man wearing a porcelain demon mask sat at her battered tea table, inspecting the surroundings as if he were sightseeing. He lifted the lid on the days old pot of inferior tea, then closed the lid before pushing the pot aside like he'd unearthed a jar of feces.\n\n\"Hi,\" Jiaojiao said, a winning smile plastering itself on her face. \"Long time no see!\"\n\n\"I've been looking for you,\" the young man said.\n\n\"Really? Whatever for?\" Jiaojiao's eyes began to dart about the room, searching for potential exit strategies. \"I'm soooo sorry about that. You know, I was really busy that day, I couldn't just sit around *waiting*...\"\n\n\"You, made me, look for you,\" the man said. \"I don't like people who waste my time.\"\n\n\"Haha,\" Jiaojiao bit back an angry response barely in time. Must remember this boy was asura incarnate with a side of psycho. \"So. Terribly. Sorry. Ahem, what did you want from me?\"\n\n\"Not much\" the boy unsheathed the sword at his waist, sending alarm bells blaring in Jiaojiao's mind. \"Don't worry. It'll be over soon.\"\n\nJiaojiao couldn't resist rolling her eyes this time. \"Look at this Guang Qiu, this is the Romeo you wanted to set me up with! It'll be over soon?\"\n\n\"Are you mad?\" Mo Wudi asked, voice only fluctuating slightly. \"Who are you talking to?\"\n\nJiaojiao laughed, high and hysterical. \"Yeah, I'm pretty fucked up right now, but I gotta say, you're not much better, prick.\"\n\nMo Wudi paused. \"Prick?\"\n\n\"Pecker. Ding-dong. Bird. Holy shit, the last words out of my mouth are going to be slang for penis what is wrong with me.\"\n\n\"Are you done?\" Mo Wudi said, an edge in his otherwise monotone voice.\n\n\"No. Hey, before you kill me, how about you hear me out, huh?\"\n\n\"...what do you want to say?\"\n\n\"I want to make a deal with you.\"","lastmodified":"2022-04-29T11:35:13.400702706Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/Chapter27-A-Candle-and-a-Conversation":{"title":"Chapter 27-A Candle and a Conversation","content":"Jiaojiao's heart felt like it would beat itself into an early retirement. Cold sweat beaded on her brow as the boy across from her froze, considering her words. She felt even more apprehensive than she had earlier, in the path of a galloping horse cart. This boy, Mo Wudi was just like a random field boss, who knew when he'd pop out to ruin her day. Except, there probably wasn't a second reset for her if she died.\n\nDid she fear death? She had a hard time finding an answer for herself. But if she was being honest, she was quite, *reluctant.*\n\n\"A deal?\"\n\n\"We can help each other.\"\n\n\"I don't need help,\" came the immediate, unswerving response.\n\nJiaojiao wanted to roll her eyes. \"Why are men always like this? Are you losing something if you admit you might benefit from a partnership?\"\n\n\"What could you possibly offer me.\"\n\n\"I have the ability to make a lot of money.\"\n\n\"I have money.\"\n\n\"Enough to start a war?\"\n\nSuddenly the sword was against her throat. There was no pain, but a droplet of warm blood ran down the length of the blade before coming to rest on the guard, as if it had been rushing to go home. It was *sharp.*\n\n\"I see Duan Zhuo knows his blades,\" Jiaojiao muttered.\n\n\"What do you know about war?\" The boy asked.\n\n\"Next to nothing,\" Jiaojiao admitted. \"But I know you want to start one.\"\n\n\"Who told you this?\"\n\n\"I can tell you,\" Jiaojiao said slyly, pettily, ignoring the angry flashing and humming of the ball hovering in her peripheral vision, \"but you have to put down the sword and have a conversation with me where I don't have to worry about the constant threat of death.\"\n\n\"What if you lie?\"\n\n\"I can make a vow. You people take those seriously, right?\"\n\nThe boy was silent, chewing her words over in his head. \"I can let you speak, but you insulted my mother yesterday. I can't let you go.\"\n\nJiaojiao smiled awkwardly. \"You would kill over some words spoken in anger? Wait, never mind, what am I saying? Of course you would.\"\n\n\"The mouth is the origin of disaster.\"\n\n\"I'm beginning to realize that.\"\n\nThe boy sheathed his sword with a flash of cold light, and soon sat in repose on at the tea table, movements like a haiku. \"I will listen to you for now. But I can't promise I won't kill you.\"\n\nJiaojiao took rummaged in one of the dusty cupboards, and unearthed a stubby candle, only about two centimeters tall. Locating the fire piston, she lit the wick and placed in on the table between them.\n\n\"I vow for as long as this candle continues to burn, I will speak the truth.\"\n\nJiaojiao shook, feeling an undefined something wrapping itself around her. She shivered, uneasy. Despite having witnessed some strange things as of late, she still had trouble accepting the existence of magic and spirit energy. Now she'd gone and stuck her foot in it herself. She cast a paranoid glance at the ceiling, feeling as if some enormous eye in the sky had glanced at her for the slightest of moments.\n\nShe shook off the strange feeling, watching as the newly lit flame cast a sheen of light on the curves of the boy's porcelain mask. She wanted to ask him to remove it, because it was bugging the crap out of her not being able to gauge his expression, but if she were honest with herself, she just wanted to get another look at his face. \n\nLook, she wasn't blind, okay? The boy was pretty.\n\nJiaojiao breathe out. \"I'm not Bai Xingyue, as you've guessed. In fact, I'm not even from this world.\"\n\nNear the ceiling, the ball was having an apoplectic fit. *Mortal! Do you know what danger you're putting yourself in?!*\n\nIf the boy felt shocked at her confession, he didn't show it. \"Explain.\"\n\nJiaojiao briefly touched on her origins, and the exact nature of how she'd ended up in Bai Xingyue's body.\n\n\"In fact, it's not a complicated story. I died and instead of doing whatever dead souls do, like reincarnate, I was put here by a--\" Jiaojiao gagged.\n\nThe empty eyes of the mask stared.\n\nJiaojiao coughed. \"As I was saying, I was put here by a spppp--\"\n\n\"Are you unwell?\" the boy asked impatiently.\n\n\"Wait a second, I seem to have come across some technical problems,\" Jiaojiao laughed angrily and turned to the ball floating smugly in the corner. \"More of your tricks?\"\n\n*I warned you not to cross me!*\n\nJiaojiao slammed a fist on the table and pointed at the ball. \"You know what? It doesn't matter! Because I know jackshit about you anyway!\"\n\nShe turned to Mo Wudi. \"Basically, I was placed here against my will, okay? By what exactly, I don't know. For a purpose I don't agree with, but I can tell you right now, I don't mean you any harm. So, can you just *relax*? Because the death threats are seriously getting old.\"\n\nThe boy was leaning slightly away from Jiaojiao, looking between her and the empty corner she was gesturing towards. He seemed to be internally debating whether Jiaojiao, was in fact, mad.\n\n\"I have heard of a case of a man,\" Mo Wudi spoke slowly. \"A *shu* son of the Mu family, who seemed to have two souls living in his body.\"\n\nJiaojiao felt her face. \"Well, normally I'd argue to the contrary, but hehe.\"\n\n\"One of his souls would act with extreme perversion, while the other would apologize for the first soul's behavior.\"\n\n\"Extreme perversion?\" Jiaojiao asked curiously. \"How extreme are we talking?\"\n\n\"He would routinely order his servants under threat of death to strip naked and dance wildly in front of his grandmoth--\"\n\n\"Alright, I'm going to stop you right there--\" Jiaojiao held up a hand. \"Yeah, I don't think you have to worry about that with me.\"\n\n\"What about--\"\n\n\"Hey, we seem to have gone *way* off topic. How about we talk about our deal, huh?\"\n\nThe boy's head tilted, giving the mask a slightly naiive, questioning air. \"Very well. What deal are you proposing?\"\n\n*Careful.* \"I can make you a lot of money. Dian Zhuo has shown you the blueprints I drew? What if I told you those were the simplest of the plans I can provide?\"\n\nA loaded pause. For a second, Jiaojiao was afraid he would ask something *dangerous* like, *\"what makes you believe I need money?\"* but instead, he said, \"What else?\"\n\n\"I can show you how to make machines capable of forever changing the textile industry in this backward ass--cough--I mean, this world. For instance, a loom that can produce many yards--er--*chi* of cloth within an hour. Or a spinning machine that can create cotton or hemp thread a thousand times the speed a human is capable of.\"\n\nMo Wudi cocked his head. \"I have heard of an all female sect in the southern forests that specialize in weaving and spinning. Only they are capable of such feats.\"\n\n\"Oh? Interesting,\" Jiaojiao leaned forward. \"What do their products look like? Do they produce clothes or are they specialized in linens? Are they also skilled in dying? What colors--\"\n\n*Mortal, focus! You have his attention!*\n\nJiaojjiao coughed, sneaking a glance at the flickering candle. \"Anyway, my machines can be operated by people with no cultivation.\"\n\nMo Wudi's mask also turned toward the candle. \"If you truly aren't lying, then perhaps you can be of use to me.\"\n\n*Could you be more patronizing?* Jiaojiao wanted to kill something. *God, I'm being talked down to by a highschooler that probably hasn't even grown in all his pubes.*\n\nBut one had to bow ones head under the eaves.\n\nThe boy's hand went to his sword hilt, but it seemed more a movement of one deep in thought than a threatening gesture. \"If you are not Bai Xingyue, then who are you?\"\n\n\"You can call me Jiaojiao.\"\n\n\"Jiaolong?\"\n\n\"Why is that always the first question? No, not jiaolong, it's *jiao*.\" She wrote the character in the air.\n\n\"Have you considered the possibility that this is all a delusion?\" The boy asked. \"Perhaps you truly believe to be a soul from a foreign world, but in fact, you are merely a girl who has been driven mad by her environment?\" the mask turned towards the surroundings, full of drab, broken things and sad memories. \"That son of the Mu family, would be your maternal uncle.\" Mo Wudi paused. \"I've heard that some diseases of the mind can be passed through the blood--\"\n\n\"That's not what's happening here, okay?\" Jiaojiao said between gritted teeth.\n\nThe mask, though fixed in a permanent demonic scowl, seemed to radiate doubt.\n\n\"You think a girl, sequestered in her courtyard all her life is capable of producing those blueprints? Where would she get the training or even the ideas?\"\n\n\"Geniuses have sprung from more unlikely backgrounds.\"\n\n\"Thanks for the compliment, but not this particular genius. Anyway,\" Jiaojiao glanced at the candle, the last of the wick about to gutter out. \"Your time is almost up. You should ask your questions quickly.\"\n\nThe mask titled the barest of angles. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\"Excuse me?\"\n\n\"Surely there is something you want in this exchange.\"\n\nJiaojiao smiled. Finally they were getting to the point! \"I need protection. It should be obvious why. My--or rather Bai Xingyue's stepmother, stepsisters, the Empress, and probably a few other randos, want me dead.\"\n\n\"What do you intend to do?\"\n\n\"What? Besides live my life? Who the hell knows?\"\n\n\"I should clarify. Do you still intend to marry the crown prince and become the mother of the country?\"\n\n*Step carefully mortal!* Guang Qiu warned.\n\n*You don't have to tell me.* Jiaojiao smiled mockingly. \"Are you afraid of me joining forces with the crown prince? Is that why you're so eager to kill me? You think I'd be on his side, because I'm his supposed fiance? Who doesn't know that the crown prince and the crippled thirteenth prince are like fire and water. Tsk, tsk. Even Bai Xingyue who never stepped out of her courtyard knows of your longstanding feud.\"\n\nThe silence was answer in itself.\n\n\"I've said before, I'm not Bai Xingyue. That engagement has nothing to do with me. Furthermore, Bai Xingyue herself didn't have much love for the crown prince.\" Jiaojiao's eyes grew hazy. \"She just wanted to be free of this fate. This engagement has brought her nothing but suffering.\"\n\nMo Wudi tapped the hilt of his sword with a long, beautifully jointed finger. \"And beyond that?\"\n\n\"Hmm? Trying to dig up all my secrets in one go, I see.\"\n\nThe finger's tapping grew in speed.\n\n\"You want to know my deepest desire? Do you think you can use it to control me?\" Jiaojiao's mouth quirked a little strangely. \"I suppose there's no harm in telling you. There's something else I want, but it's not something you can help me with.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Can you raise the dead?\"\n\nThe candle went out. A thin strand of smoke rose and scattered, leaving a scorched scent.\n\n\"I cannot.\"\n\n\"Then there's no point talking about it.\"\n\nSilence. \n\n\"Do we have a deal?\" Jiaojiao hesitantly offered her hand.\n\nMo Wudi stood, ignoring the outstretched hand poised between them. \"I will be in touch.\"\n\nThe next second, the space where he stood was vacant. Only the slight whoosh of displaced air suggested that the entire conversation hadn't taken place in Jiaojiao's confused mind.\n\nJiaojiao let out a breath she hadn't realized she'd been holding. \"That boy is going to give me heart disease,\" she said, holding her chest.\n\n*This is good progress. At least he doesn't seem to want to kill you anymore.*\n\n\"Who knows what's going on in that boy's head? For all we know, he'll come back tonight and lop off my head while I'm sleeping.\"\n\nHe'd done such things in the book after all. Jiaojiao fell back on the *kang*, the abused furniture giving a plaintive groan. No matter. Just field each crisis as it comes.","lastmodified":"2022-04-29T11:35:13.400702706Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/Chapter28-Binding-the-Artifact":{"title":"Chapter 28-Binding the Artifact","content":"*Mortal! Mortal!*\n\nJiaojiao cracked her eyes open, straining them in the gloomy light from the window. An insistent nagging ache in her stomach, translated itself as hunger after her cottony mind restarted. She must have dozed off in the post-adrenaline crash after that nerve-wracking conversation with the slash-happy Mo Wudi.\n\n\"What do you want Guang Qiu, I feel like *death*.\"\n\n*Haven't you lazed about long enough? You've been napping for hours. It's the afternoon.*\n\nNo wonder she was starving. She hadn't had breakfast, or even had a proper dinner the night before, with Cen Wei rushing her off to bed after she'd failed to respond normally to conversation. Had she even had lunch yesterday? Jiaojiao thought back to that vague blot of memory. Wasn't it quite sad that the best meals she'd taken were in a slum orphanage since transmigrating? Should she just run away from this mess and become a nun? Granny Chu *was* rather overworked. Perhaps--\n\n*Mortal have you become stupid?*\n\nJiaojiao groaned into the dusty blankets. \"If there's something wrong with me, then it's one hundred percent your fault!\"\n\n*After you're done sulking, I want you to behave rationally! It's high time for bind the artifact and resume the proper path!*\n\nJiaojiao glared at the ball, then scanned the dim corners of the room for the bracelet she'd yeeted earlier in the day. It lay there where she'd left it, sad, abandoned, and with a layer of grey lint.\n\nShe picked it up with a huff and polished it on a handful bed covers. \"This thing has a magical dimension inside? Why does it look like something I can buy for five dollars off of Taobao?\"\n\n*Don't dismiss it so eagerly! It's true appearance has been sealed!*\n\n\"What do I have to do in order to bind it?\" Jiaojiao skimmed the contents of the webnovel in her mind, then scowled. \"I have to cut myself? How unsanitary.\"\n\n*Don't be so cowardly, it's just a prick of a finger! I'm not asking you to cut off a piece of flesh!*\n\n\"Why do I get the feeling that you wouldn't hesitate to chop off all my limbs if that's what it took?\"\n\n*Would you hurry up!?*\n\nJiaojiao took a full ten minutes before she found a needle and another stubby candle in another one of the cluttered drawers while Guang Qiu complained loudly and impatiently at her ear. She ignored the ball as she carefully sanitized the needle in the flame, then hesitated with the sharp point poised over her left index.\n\n\"If I perish of tetanus, it will be entirely your fault.\"\n\n*Just do it, you coward!*\n\nJiaojiao turned her head aside squeamishly as she stabbed down, wincing at the prick.\n\n*You survived the resetting of your leg, why are you so afraid of pain?* Guang Qiu mocked.\n\n\"Should I be ashamed of having a healthy fear of pain? Not everyone can be like your precious, masochistic Bai Jing.\"\n\nThe heroine of \"The Cold Prince Loves me Dearly\" had a taste for pain, both emotional and physical in Jiaojiao's discerning judgement. Not only had she jumped into a tumultuous romance with that psycho, Mo Wudi, but she often went on self-directed, torturous training excursions in uncivilized forests, deserts, and strange mystical lands, hunting creatures and fighting this and that.\n\nIt all sounded like such a terrible time. How did she shower? How did she go to the bathroom?\n\nNot to mention her strange predilection for attracting trouble. She often brawled with every rando who took issue with her, getting chased by those with superior fighting power, getting smacked around to the point of spitting blood, or getting her body slashed open. \n\nNot only that, her cultivation exercises sounded like elaborate torture yoga. Even various tonics she ate to level up were described as \"bone-breaking\" and causing a \"cold sweat\" from pain. What a weird woman.\n\n*Why do I feel like you are thinking bad things about me?* The ball asked suspiciously.\n\n\"Probably because I am. Is something supposed to happen?\" Jiaojiao asked finally, some thirty seconds after the drop of blood had fallen onto the bracelet.\n\nThe ball hovered closer to the bracelet. *It's... maybe it just needs some time?*\n\nA few minutes passed. Jiaojiao poked at the bracelet lying on the table in front of her.\n\n*... maybe you should try again?*\n\n\"What? Next you'll be asking me to turn it on and off again.\" Jiaojiao complained.\n\nAnother prick, another drop.\n\nThe bracelet continued to lay there, blood splattered and unreactive.\n\n\"Heh, I'm going to laugh if it's broken or something.\"\n\n*It can't be! Perhaps you just need to add more blood!*\n\nJiaojiao slapped the table. \"Easy for you to say when it's not you getting stabbed over and over!\"\n\n*Then what could be the matter?!* Guang Qiu asked, voice buzzing with tension.\n\nJiaojiao watched, bored as the ball hovered over the bracelet, light dimming and brightening, no doubt interacting with the piece of wood in ways she couldn't understand.\n\nA minute passed, then another. The light on the ball grew dimmer, as if each passing second was expending an untold amount of energy.\n\n*...*\n\n\"It's broken isn't it?\"\n\nThe ball *slumped*. If a ball of light could be described as depressed, it would be Guang Qiu, with it's brightness levels faint, it's subsonic hum thinning to a gossamer thread.\n\n*This cannot be!* It whispered.\n\n\"What now?\"\n\n*The bracelet... has sustained severe damage. It shows traces of having been struck with a inter-dimensional turbulence.*\n\nJiaojiao swiped the bracelet from the table and brought it close to the candlelight. *There,* in the flickering light, between two abstract carvings, was a hairline crack.\n\n*There is no sign of the guardian. The space within has been broken. The artifact is just a piece of trash now. Where could--*\n\nJiaojiao looked up with a smile as the ball choked off its own words. \"You wanted to know where Bai Jing was, huh?\"\n\nHer smile took a more sarcastic curve as the ball froze, whether it was guilt or surprise, she didn't know, nor did she particularly care. \"Relax, I knew it from the start that you were looking for Bai Jing. After all, I'll be the first to admit I'm not qualified for the mission you've saddled me with.\"\n\n*You're not... angry?*\n\n\"In order to be angry, I would first need to have expectations or trust, and quite wisely, I've refrained from placing either on you.\" She tapped the damaged artifact on the table. \"Too bad for you, looks like Bai Jing might have had an *accident.*\"\n\nIf it were possible, the ball seemed to deflate even further. If it had a human body, Jiaojiao imagined it would be slumped over in defeat, head in its hands.\n\n\"Guess you're stuck with me now,\" Jiaojiao tossed the artifact in the air and caught it again.\n\nSuddenly, with there was dim sparkle. A rectangular object slammed to the middle of the tea table, with gravid *whump*, bounced twice, knocking over the porcelain tea pot. Jiaojiao drew back to avoid the spillage of old tea leaves and stale water. \n\n*What is it?* Guang Qiu zipped over, as if injected with jet fuel.\n\nJiaojiao threw open the old window to let in a wash of gloomy light. The sun had failed to emerge on this day and the sky was heavy with unspilled rain.\n\n\"Looks like a book.\"\n\nAnd it was *chonkin'*. Jiaojiao had seen encyclopedias with less pages. By eye, she estimated it was several thousand pages. The aged cloth binding was sepia with time, the pages visibly brittle. An archaic seal script was emblazoned on the cover in bold, frenetic strokes, as if the author was in crazed state while writing it.\n\nJiaojiao touched it with an index, the cloth covering felt like cool silk over a wooden board. Strange, alien plants were woven and embossed in the fabric. \"Don't tell me...\"\n\n*It's the alchemic tome!* Guang Qiu cried. Jiaojiao held a hand in front of her eyes to shield herself from the blinding light the ball emitted.\n\nIt was like it had revived full health after chugging a rare elixir.\n\nJiaojiao squinted at the complicated script. Cracked open the cover, which came with a fragrance that reminded her of her grandmother and old traditional Chinese medicine shops. \"I can't read a word of this.\"\n\n*I can translate!* Guang Qiu cried, as if Red Bull had given it wings.\n\nJiaojiao looked at the bracelet again. If she smacked it around some more would it give her more surprises? She rapped it on the table, but it didn't spit out any more lost magical tomes. A shame.\n\n*Would you stop that? Even if it's broken, it should still be treated with respect! Especially from a lowly mortal!*\n\n\"Didn't Bai Jing heal this body after taking a few old pills?\" Jiaojiao asked. \"You know this body is broken beyond repair even if we have the tome. I don't have the skills to make pills and even if you can translate for me, it will take me a long time to learn.\"\n\nGuang Qiu's light dimmed again, as if Jiaojiao had harshly pricked its bubble of optimism.\n\n*It is indeed a problem,* the ball sighed. *I did another scan of the bracelet. It seems there is no longer a dimensional space within. It is merely a low-grade storage artifact.*\n\n\"How do I use it?\"\n\n*Just hold it in your hands and have the intention to store or withdraw.*\n\nJiaojiao tried it. The book disappeared from the table. A few seconds later it reappeared with another *whump,* only to disappear again. This repeated a few times.\n\n*Would you stop it? Treat the book with some respect! It's several thousands of years old! The knowledge held within is priceless!*\n\n\"Uh-huh.\" Jiaojiao paused in her antics to hold her stomach, which chose this moment to let out an indignant growl. \"I'm starving.\"\n\n*You mortals are so troublesome,* Guang Qiu sighed. *Go get something to eat. We have much to do!*\n\nJiaojiao was about to make her way to Hu Maoxun's in hopes of cadging another meal, when there came a tentative knock on the door of her residence. She frowned. She wasn't acquainted with many people and the ones off the top of her head, like Bai Xingwu, Mo Wudi. etc, were not the type to knock politely.\n\nShe warily made her way to the front door, swiping up the makeshift club on the way.\n\nBai Xingyun stood on the threshold, smiling sheepishly and holding aloft a straw basket that smelled like *meat.*\n\nJiaojiao hadn't had meat for *years.* Even before transmigrating, she had been vegan. And after transmigrating, she hadn't encountered meat, other than as a phantom fragrance on her various rickshaw rides through the city.\n\n\"What do you want?\" Jiaojiao asked, even as her mouth sloshed with a traitorous flood of saliva.\n\n\"I was bringing lunch to Concubine Hu, and I had extra...\"\n\nTwo minutes later, the two of them were seated on opposite sides of the tea table, Jiaojiao having silently renounced her vegan ways. She was too hungry to worry about dietary trends, and really, could her thirteen million fans call her out for it?\n\nJiaojiao ate without her usual grace, with her head bent ravenously over the steamed buns, full of diced pork, and mushrooms that tasted like shiitake, though the color was a bit bluer than what she was used too, once again reminding her she was in another world. The distinct flavours danced on her deprived tongue. How many years had it been since this body tasted meat? Had it ever tasted meat? The corner of her mind now devoted to Bai Xingyue's memories provided the answer that it had been as many as eight years.\n\nJiaojiao was too hungry to ask the boy too many questions. As for poison? Jiaojiao believed that there were easier ways to kill a defenseless girl such as herself, especially for an able-bodied young man like the one sitting across from her.\n\nWhy fuck around when you could just slap her dead with a palm? In fact, she had doubts as to why the Empress and Head wife Zhang were using such inefficient methods to off a mere girl with no martial expertise to speak of.\n\nWhen she had eaten three buns and was feeling a bit more human, Jiaojiao pulled over the bowl of steaming hot soup the boy presented to her and brought it up to her lips.\n\n\"Be careful, it's hot.\"\n\nWhen she had finished the satisfying bowl of chicken broth, a black chicken leg waited a the bottom. She pushed it aside then gave the boy a strained smile, wiping the grease from her lips with a provided handkerchief.\n\n\"So, why are you really here?\" Jiaojiao asked.","lastmodified":"2022-04-29T11:35:13.400702706Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/NaNoWriMo-April-2022":{"title":"üå± NaNoWriMo-April 2022","content":"---\n\nI've had this idea for a book series bouncing around for quite some time and [NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org/what-is-camp-nanowrimo) was just the excuse that I needed to jumpstart the whole endeavor.
