From the scuffed corners of the _hongmu_ armoire, to the cracked surface of the low tea table with mother of pearl inlay, every detail screamed of bygone grandeur. The mustiness in the air hinted at age and neglect.\n\nJIaojiao didn't react for a good ten seconds, staring here and there at the ratty paper windows, thrice mended and patched with ragged bits of cloth, at the exposed brown bricks beyond the cracked lime plaster, at the moth eaten covers over her too-small lap. She held up her bony hands, chapped, with yellowed uneven nails.\n\n\"Oh no,\" Jiaojiao spoke aloud. \"I'm having a stroke.\"\n\nBecause, that could be the only explanation for this... this farce of a hallucination, right? She had only just been arguing with... who was it? Right, Superb_Ninja2394, defending her controversial decision to pair Galaxy Sunrise nail polish with hot pink stripes and gold decals. Why else would she be seeing this scene out of a half-baked period drama. It was a stroke.\n\nA stroke. It had to be.\n\nBecause... what would be the alternative?\n\nWith mounting horror, Jiaojiao used her not-her-hands to touch her not-her-face. It was small, thin, and _unmoisturized_. _Who was this person?_\n\nShe didn't get to dwell on it further before the door to the bedroom burst open with a crack of distressed wood.\n\n\"Bai Xingyue, you slut!\" cried a sweet young voice.\n\nFramed in the doorway, with her leg still raised in a high-kick, was a young girl in a pink _hanfu_, perhaps twelve to fifteen years old. Pearled hairpins in the shapes of flowers and birds swayed with her movements. Her tender face was scrunched in a scowl that was more cute in the way of angry kittens and growling puppies, than intimidating.\n\nBai Xingyue? Is she talking about _not-me_?\n\nThe girl didn't waste a second rushing into the room, hand raised in a maneuver Jiaojiao recognized well as the classic posture for a slap, so well exemplified in Chinese harem dramas. She shifted out of the way, though her body responded much more sluggishly than she was used to.\n\nThe angry girl's pink embroidered sleeves billowed as her fist landed on the traditional _kang_ bed. Rather than bouncing off the woven bottom as Jiaojiao expected, that tiny palm blasted through in an explosion of bamboo shards.\n\n\"You dare dodge?!\" The girl screeched, then pouted at the _audacity_.\n\nJiaojiao was too baffled to speak. What then? So should she stay still and get her head smashed in? The hell was with this strength? Was this ninety pound loli She-ra incarnate?\n\n\"I-- I'm sorry?\" Jiaojiao finally rasped out, noting that the voice was not her voice, but what else was new? The moment the words were out of her-- _not-her mouth_, there was a brief buzz in Jiaojiao's mind. Jiaojiao frowned, raising a hand to her head. More signs she was having a stroke, surely.\n\n\"You think apologizing is enough?\" the girl sneered, hand raised for another slap. \"You slut. Why didn't you just drown in that pond?¬†You think such lowly tactics would attract the crown prince? Naive!\"\n\n*What was this about a crown prince? So this is a historical drama? What dynasty? Is this a drama with wuxia elements?* Jiaojiao thought wildly to herself. How else to explain this girls strength? Her mind swiftly ran the gamut of routine hypotheticals. *Is this a movie set? Am I getting punked? Where are the cameras? Where is the crew? Is this a dream? Why am I even thinking about this? I could be dying right as we speak, brain cells withering from lack of oxygen! Are the paramedics even on the way?* Knowing her usual audience they wouldn't care to call for help even if it became obvious rigor was setting in.\n\n_Doomed. I'm doomed._\n\nThe pink loli didn't take kindly to being ignored. Jiaojiao felt a distinct danger to her hallucinatory life as that white hand descended for another slap. She hastily rolled away though she felt serious doubts about her current situation. Surely none of this mattered even if her head did became roadkill? That is-- If she truly was having a stroke. The bed groaned as another hole appeared by the first.\n\n\"The crown prince wouldn't even deign to let you lick his shoes! You're a toad lusting for swan meat!\" The girl sneered. \"You should just kill yourself and save me the trouble of dirtying my hands!\"\n\n\"The crown prince?\" Jiaojiao parroted, curled up in the corner of the bed, bracketed by wall and headboard and and covered in bamboo slivers.\n\n\"You still have the face to speak of the crown prince!?\"\n\nThird slap incoming, Jiaojiao had run out of rolling space. She hastily raised both hands in a gesture of surrender. \"Wait!\"\n\nThe girl paused and regarded Jiaojiao in disgust. Behind her, two servants in plain blue robes had entered at some point and were staring at Jiaojiao in shaudenfraude.\n\n\"I have no interest in the crown prince,\" Jiaojiao said. It was the truth, who was this crown prince even?\n\n\"Hah! As if I would believe your lies!\"\n\n\"Hold on!\" Jiaojiao called, interrupting that hand descending like a guillotine. \"I-- I've lost my memories!\"\n\n\"Hah?\" The girl glared, but the hand remained suspended.\n\n\"I... don't even know who you are?\" Jiaojiao supplied.\n\nThe girl scrutinized Jiaojiao from head to toe, as if there would be physical signs to elude to the veracity of that statement. She leaned forward, staring into Jiaojiao's face.\n\n\"Don't believe her, young miss,\" one of the servants interrupted.\n\n\"She's just lying to escape punishment,\" the other servant agreed.\n\nJiaojiao met the girl's gaze straight on. \"I really truly have lost my memories. I don't even know my own name.\"\n\n\"What a liar,\" the first servant laughed. \"Just slap her to death.\"\n\n\"Slap her to death!\"\n\n_What is wrong with these people?_\n\n\"Hmph,\" the girl finally smiled. \"So what if you don't remember? Now hold still so I can rid the world of an eyesore.\"\n\n\"You're seriously trying to kill her-- me?\" Jiaojiao asked with doubt.\n\n\"You finally understand,\" the girl smiled. Objectively, it was a nice smile on a pretty face, but it made the hairs stand up on the back of Jiaojiao's neck.\n\n\"Can we talk about this?\" Jiaojiao scrunched herself as far as she could go into the corner.\n\n\"What is there to talk about? You should have died back there in that pond. I'm just finishing the job.\"\n\nJiaojiao could only watch as that hand resumed its merciless descent, a harsh buzz began in her mind as the palm neared her unprotected face. The buzz reached an annoying crescendo then cut off with a wrathful pop.\n\nA bright box bloomed into view, floating in Jiaojiao's vision like a phantom.\n\nSimultaneously, the girl's descending slap suddenly veered off to the right and hit the wall with a crackle of broken plaster.\n\nThough her face had narrowly escaped getting pancaked by mere millimeters, Jiaojiao could only stare at the floating box in befuddlement. It was a translucent screen with a block of white text scrolling past and looked like something out of a VR simulation.\n\nThe girl hissed and shook out her blushing palm, smarting from the impact to the brick wall. \"You bitch, how dare you dodge!?\"\n\nThe servants darted forward, cooing in distress over their mistress's hand.\n\n\"You wretch! How could you hurt the miss's hand like this!\"\n\nJiaojiao was too distracted to answer, eyes riveted on the contents of that floating box that no one else seemed to see.\n\n*Bai Jing woke in a dirty old bedroom...**\n\n_Bai Jing smiled enchantingly as she caught Bai Xingwu's hand in an iron fist..._\n\n_Bai Jing kicked the girl away with her slim leg..._\n\n_Bai Jing slapped the impudent servant..._\n\n_Bai Jing..._\n\n\"Who the fuck is Bai Jing?\" Jiaojiao said.\n\nThe girl and the two servants stared agog at her outburst.\n\n\"Is there a Bai Jing in the family?\"\n\n\"I don't think so.\"\n\n\"What is she staring at?\"\n\n\"Maybe she's finally gone crazy.\"\n\n\"Heh! If I were her, I would've have gone crazy when I first heard I was a martial cripple.\"\n\n\"I would have just hung myself and ended it all.\"\n\n\"How could the crown prince have such a hideous toad for a fianc√©?\"\n\nThe servants tittered.\n\n\"Silence!\" The girl snapped, still rubbing her sore hand. \"Don't speak of the crown prince with your lowly mouths!\"\n\nThe servants bowed their heads. Though chastised, the corners of their lips turned up as they snuck glances at Jiaojiao and the girl in pink, no doubt anticipating the ensuing carnage.\n\nWhat bunch of manipulative she-devils.\n\nJiaojiao finally turned her gaze back to the bristling girl in pink, having finished digesting the contents of the floating box-- though not all of it made sense, she was beginning to get a hint of what was going on.\n\n\"Is your name Bai Xingwu?\"\n\nThe girl curled her lip up in ridicule. \"I thought you lost your memories?\"\n\n\"So it is,\" Jiaojiao pointed to the ghostly text box. \"None of you see that?\"\n\n\"See what? Don't think pretending to be crazy will get you out of anything!\"\n\n\"What do you want me to do?\" Jiaojiao asked, exasperated. \"Should I just lie down and let you kill me?\"\n\n\"It would be your honor to be killed by me!\"\n\nJiaojiao refrained from rolling her eyes. \"What can I do so that you won't kill me?\"\n\nBai Xingwu smiled, eyes crinkling in mirthful crescents. \"Kowtow. Kowtow until I tell you to stop.\"\n\n*And what if you never tell me to stop?* Jiaojiao rebutted internally. \"Fine,\" she said instead with a diplomatic smile and crawled off of the _kang_, avoiding the wreckage of the girl's punches. She paused as her right leg gave a twinge in pain.\n\n\"What are you waiting for?\" Bai Xingwu prodded, her smile mean and knowing.\n\nJiaojiao shuffled awkwardly to the dusty floor, then knelt, right knee now screaming in protest. There was definitely something up with that leg but she didn't currently have the time to address it. She took a distracted moment to admire Bai Xingwu's pearl-studded shoes, then lowered her head in the first kowtow, grimacing as the dirty floor neared her face. After a minute pause, her forehead touched the ground with an audible tap.\n\nThe harsh buzzing began anew. The girl gave her a pointed glare when Jiaojiao paused in thought.\n\n_It's all a stroke anyway! Why am I worrying?_\n\nOnly Jiaojiao knew herself fairly well, and she wasn't imaginative enough to dream this shit up by far.\n\nShe was feeling pain in a hallucination-- maybe not a hallucination. Every sight, smell, and feeling was indicating that she might _possibly, not really, actually_ be having a stroke.\n\nJiaojiao grit her teeth and began her second kowtow. Ignoring the buzzing in her head. A new box of text popped up next to the first, bobbing insistently. She gave it a cursory glance, then covertly rolled her eyes.\n\n_Bai Jing laughed as the servant wailed in pain..._\n\n_Bai Jing broke Bai Xingwu's hand with a snap of her wrist..._\n\n_\"How dare you call this great aunt a slut? Are you speaking of yourself?\"_\n\nOn her fifth kowtow, sweat began to head on her brow. Jiaojiao didn't enjoy pain and in fact usually went out of her way to avoid it-- like a normal person. This experience was swiftly becoming the most painful one she'd ever had the misfortune of encountering.\n\nJiaojiao touched her head to the dusty floor for the six time, the ground now damp with her sweat.\n\n\"Cry for me,\" Bai Xingwu suggested cooly. \"Ask for my forgiveness.\"\n\nWith a sniff, Jiaojiao began to wail and covered her face with her dusty hands, pressing down on her eyelids until her tear glands welled up with physiological tears. Blinking rapidly, she choked on her sobs as she coyly looked down.\n\n\"Hah! You're so ugly,\" the girl said, \"kowtow to me nine times and I'll let you go for today!\"\n\nThe ground beneath her face was now dotted with tears as well as saliva and sweat. Jiaojiao wailed theatrically, face coated in dust and grime.\n\n\"Look how ugly she is.\"\n\n\"Hideous.\"\n\n\"So disgusting.\"\n\nJiaojiao sobbed noisily, slurping a disgusting mixture of snot and tears with every inhale and exhale. The buzzing had now grown to deafening levels and Jiaojiao could hardly hear the servants deprecating commentary. Jiaojiao's entire focus had narrowed to the pain in her leg, and she had begun shaking from maintaining her posture. Only a certain premonition was preventing her from breaking this farce of a scene.\n\nThankfully, Bai Xingwu soon grew bored of the spectacle and takes before swinging her head, hairpins flashing with lustrous light.\n\n\"Let this be a lesson to you, slut! Don't you dare covet the crown prince! He is the heavens and you are less than dirt,\" the girl spat, then left with a swish of her sleeves, leaving behind only the scent of jasmine. Her two servants shot Jiaojiao one last ridiculing glance, then scurried after their mistress, kicking the ruins of the door aside on their way out.\n\nJiaojiao's cries cut off with an abruptness that struck of artificiality. She wiped her face with a tattered sleeve and regarded her departing audience with a lackluster expression.\n\nWhen the trio disappeared from view, so too did the buzzing cease.\n\nThe air grew heavy and solemn as Jiaojiao scanned her surroundings, hobbling back to the _kang_, now sporting two mango sized holes.\n\n\"All right, there's no one here,\" Jiaojiao said to the air. \"Come out.\"","lastmodified":"2022-04-08T11:06:54.271654654Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/Chapter02-The-Missing-Heroine":{"title":"Chapter 02-The Missing Heroine","content":"There was a heavy silence the moment Jiaojiao spoke to the empty room. Oppressive and somehow, sullen.\n\n*How did you know?* A voice asked sourly in her head. It was an ambiguous voice with a distinct lack of defining characteristics, neither male nor female and neither young or old.\n\n\"Did you think you were being subtle with the buzzing and humming?\" Jiaojiao scoffed, scanning the room for the disembodied voice. \"It was like having a silenced phone go off directly by my ear. Where are you anyway?\"\n\nA dim cloud of light, about the size of two fists popped into existence directly in front of Jiaojiao. She eyed it curiously. This was the the source of infernal buzzing?\n\n\"Who are you? What the hell is going on?\"\n\n*Who I am is none of your concern.*\n\n\"I'd say that's a sizzling hot take given that you're a hundred percent responsible for--\" she gestured at her current body.\n\nThe ball of light gave a disdainful buzz. *You're not required to know.*\n\n*Wow.* \"You got a name?\"\n\nThere came a prickling feeling from the cloud of light that Jiaojiao translated as irritation. *That's not important. What is important is that you were a disgrace just now. Why did you kowtow?*\n\n\"And what was the alternative? Let her squash me like a rice cake?\"\n\n*You could have fought back,* the ball of light grumbled. *You should-- what are you doing?!*\n\nJiaojiao tsked as her hand closed around nothing, the ball of light darting away from her grasping fingers. \n\n*How ill-mannered!* The ball scolded. *Keep your hands to yourself!*\n\n\"I'd say you've gone way beyond the boundaries of rudeness when you whisked my-- what? Soul? Into this place.\"\n\n*Can you be compared to me, puny mortal?*\n\n\"Puny mortal? Oh, it's like that is it?\" Jiaojiao smiled thinly. \"What does that make you, a god?\"\n\n*I may as well be a god!*\n\n\"Well, forgive me my impudence, oh *god*.\"\n\nA grudging hum. *You are forgiven, mortal. I myself made an error in judgement. I should not have put much expectation in your decorum in the first place given your... occupation.*\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n*You are after all--* a delicate pause *--an entertainer.*\n\n\"Entertain-- what?\"\n\n*And entertainers are not known for their refined behavior.*\n\nJiaojiao eyed the ball of light in thought. It seemed, the thing, god or whatever, had a superficial understanding of her, and an even worse understanding of the world she came from. And his sensibilities were downright ancient.\n\n\"What makes you think I'm an entertainer?\" she asked.\n\n*What else would you call what you do? You display yourself for the amusement of others. Is this not the definition of an entertainer? A lowly occupation with no meaningful worth to society?*\n\n\"Christ, who are you, my mother?\"\n\n*But we seem to have ventured onto a tangental thread of conversation. We were discussing--what are you doing now?!*\n\nJiaojiao ignored the ball and lifted the hem of her frayed robes and rolled up her pants to look at that damned right leg that had been troubling her. A knotted expanse of scar tissue and a crooked calf met her horrified gaze. She silently dropped the hem of her robe. *Not my body, not my problem.*\n\n*See this is exactly what I meant! No lady-like bearing at all! Baring your flesh for all the world to see!*\n\n\"The world isn't in here. Just you,\" Jiaojiao said. \"And besides, shouldn't it be you who is in the wrong for being in a young girl's boudoir?\"\n\n*As I was saying,* the ball's light pulsed with rage, *you have a lot to answer for, you disgraceful harlot.*\n\n\"No, don't hold back on my account. Tell me what you really think.\"\n\n*You bowed and scraped like a beggar. Have you seen yourself?*\n\n\"No actually,\" Jiaojiao answered. \"I can say with all honesty I have never seen myself.\"\n\n*Well, you are an absolute shame to behold! I am embarrassed on your behalf! Did you really have to kowtow?* the ball of light continued. *If you could have just--*\n\n\"Fought back?\" she pointed at her leg. \"You've seen the leg. This body is basically crippled.\"\n\n*Bai Jing did it, and she had the same leg. She fought Bai Xingwu and won. That's how it's supposed to go. Bai Xingwu and her two servants retreat in terror after losing to Bai Jing in a three on one fight.* The ball of light paused, and a heavy sense of oppression emanated from it. *At least, that's how it's supposed to go.*\n\nJiaojiao smiled a smile that wasn't a smile. \"Say, are you confused about something? What do those three have to do with me? Why should any of this have anything to do with me? You and I both know that I'm not this Bai Jing person.\"\n\nA heavy pause. The light flickered like a staticky TV.\n\n*Interesting.* The it finally said. *Most people would hesitate before admitting they weren't the person meant to be here. After all, you just died and it can be surmised that I'm the sole reason you still live and breathe...**\n\n\"Yes, yes, yes, you are very mighty, very powerful, I am very impress,\" Jiaojiao waved a hand. \"That doesn't change the fact that I am not Bai Jing and you can't expect me to behave like her.\"\n\n*You don't have a choice. You have already died. The person you were no longer exists. If you cannot be Bai Jing then there is no use for you at all.*\n\nJiaojiao wrinkled her nose then took a sniff of her shoulder, having been nagged by the faint smell of mildew ever since waking. She got a whiff of stagnant water and algae. A tell-tale patch of green on her sleeve drew her attention. Well, that angry little girl had said something about a near drowning. A completed drowning? After all, *she* was here.\n\n*It should be obvious that I hold your very life and death in my hands...*\n\nJiaojiao sidestepped the ball and hobbled over to the battered armoire taking a hold of the ornated bronze handles, green with oxidation. When a firm tug left the doors unbudging, she leveraged all eighty-five pounds of her new body to wrench it open. Her arms ached with the strain and the nerves in her bum leg screamed in protest. The doors stuck on each other, swollen with age and moisture. A glance overhead revealed a patch of missing roof tiles, repaired haphazardly with a few handfuls of thatch and straw twine.\n\nInside the armoire was a collection of worn and aged clothing, moth-eaten silk and frayed cotton in various washed out colors. Jiaojiao paused. Did she really have to don these... these *rags*?\n\n*If you want to continue living, you will do well to follow my instructions... are you listening to me?*\n\n\"Yes, I am very invested in this conversation. Do continue.\"\n\n*You are dead.*\n\n\"Uh huh.\"\n\n*... shouldn't you be more upset?*\n\n \"What?\" Jiaojiao rifled through the meager selection of *hanfu*. \"Should I be weeping and wailing? Groveling at your feet for absolution?\"\n\n*It would be the expected reaction.*\n\n\"I'm already dead, what's to be done?'\" Jiaojiao said. \"I won't waste my time begging you for something you won't change. After all, if you were truly kind, you would have revived me in my own body instead of casting me as this Bai Jing person.\"\n\nA hum of grudging agreement came from the ball. *I brought you here for a purpose.*\n\nJIaojiao chose one of the least ratty robes and pulled it from the armoire. \"Avert your virgin eyes, o' god, for this filthy mortal entertainer is about to disrobe.\"\n\nThe ball gave a disgusted snarl and zipped to hide behind the armoire door. *Have you heard a single word I've said? Must you do that now?*\n\n\"Dead mortal, alive on your grace, here for a mission. I'm all ears. And yes, I'm reeking of pond scum, and I simply cannot stand it a second longer.\"\n\n*...as I was saying, your only purpose here is to take the place of Bai Jing.*\n\n\"What happened to her anyway?\" Jiaojiao asked as she shucked the damp robe from her body. It was of noticeably finer make and she would have preferred wearing it to the beggars garment she was shortly about to don were it not foul with pond water.\n\nThe ball of light paused, as if loathe to disclose an iota more information than absolutely necessary. *She failed the appear at the correct time. We were forced to take drastic measures to ensure the continuity of this fateline.*\n\nJiaojiao's eyes flashed as she bowed her head to tie the belt on her clean robe. *Fate-line? Does that have something to do with that box of text I just saw?* \"So I have her to thank for this second life?\"\n\n*You have __me__ to thank for this second life.*\n\n\"Sure boss, whatever you say.\"\n\n*I'm glad you understand your position. Just do as you're told and all will be well.*\n\n\"What happens if I don't do as I'm told?\"\n\nThe ball of light floated in front of Jiaojiao. A palpable oppression prickled at her skin as the light burst in intensity, bright stripes strobed across its surface. *Then I'll get rid of you and find a more obedient replacement.* \n\nJiaojiao shivered, then smiled thinly. \"Got it.\"\n\nThe ball seemed satisfied with her response, withdrawing out of arms reach and the light dimmed to less blinding levels.\n\n\"So what do I have to do?\"\n\nThe light began to strobe again. *Hold still, this will only hurt a bit.*\n\nThe world exploded into light.\n\nJiaojiao eyes stung as the light hit her eyes, she lifted an arm to shield herself, but it didn't seem to make a difference. The it was like the light was piercing straight past her flesh and directly impacting her brain tissue. The beginnings of a migraine began to make itself known as dense blocks of text scrolled past her vision at an accelerated pace. Even as Jiaojiao thought that this was far too fast for anyone to read, the information seared itself into her mind as though it was being directly funneled into her synapses.\n\n*Bai Jing stood at the cliffside with her lover Fei Chen. The distant sunset gave a romantic backdrop to their rendevous.*\n\n*\"Fel Chen, it has been almost ten years since we made that promise.\"\n\n*\"I remember...\"*\n\n*\"We can leave everything behind now...\"*\n\n*Fei Chen embraced Bai Jing, smiling down at his beautiful fiance. Bai Jing smiled and turned her face upwards to receive his fiery kiss...*\n\n*Bai Jing gasped, the pulled back at a sudden sharp pain on her chest. Right over her heart pierced a dagger. A brilliant blood-red flower bloomed...*\n\n*\"Why?\" she asked the sinisterly smiling Fei Chen.*\n\n\"I've never loved you, Bai Jing? Who would love a coarse mercenary like you? My true love is your half-sister! I was only after the inheritance your mother left you!\" \n\n*Fei Chen snatched the embroidered pouch from Bai Jing's chilled fingers.*\n\n*\"Fei Chen, you better pray I don't live, or I'll make you sorry...\"*\n\n*Bai Jing plunged from the cliff...*\n\nJiaojiao could only stand, transfixed as more text scrolled past her vision. She screwed her eyes shut, but nothing could stop the information pouring into her mind. Dear lord this is torture.\n\n*Bai Jing awoke in an ancient bedroom...*\n\n*Bai Jing spoke to the reflection in the bronze mirror. \"Fate has given me a second chance, I won't let your sacrifice go to waste. I will avenge all your grievamces and punish all those who drove you to your death!\"\"*\n\n*Bai Jing kicked Bai Xingwu across the room...*\n\n*Bai Jing smiled...*\n\n*Bai Jing laughed...*\n\n*Bai Jing sneered...*\n\nJiaojiao felt like she was going crazy. On and on it went until finally the text slowed to a crawl before disappearing with a faint pop. She opened her eyes and gave the ball of light a dirty look.\n\n*Well?* The ball of light said impatiently, *Did you get all of it?*\n\nJiaojiao gave a mirthless chuckle. \"Oh I got it. There's just one little problem.\"\n\n*What is it?*\n\n\"Are you kidding? You made it sound like some grand mission but I can't do this,\" JIaojiao shook her head. \"Nope. I can't help you.\" \n\n*I don't follow.*\n\n\"You don't need a heroine! You need an editor! Nothing less will save us from this crappy webnovel!\"","lastmodified":"2022-04-08T11:06:54.271654654Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/Chapter03-The-Cold-Prince-Loves-Me-Dearly":{"title":"Chapter 03-The Cold Prince Loves Me Dearly","content":"\"The Cold Prince Loves me Dearly?\" Jiaojiao could barely get the words out through her upset. \"You brought me here for this?\"\n\n*I fail to see what the problem is.*\n\n\"Fail to see the problem-- of course you would. You're not he one being forced to play out over five hundred chapters of nonsense!\"\n\n*Actually, it's over five thousand, but I didn't want to overload your puny mortal brain with too much information at once.*\n\n*Lord, guanyin, yama, whoever, save me from this farce.* Jiaojiao slumped over the *kang.* A webnovel! Not only was this a webnovel, it was a badly written one too, with plot holes, repetitive plot lines and more tired tropes than she could care to name. Not only that, it was of the xianxia genre, heavily featuring a romance she found highly problematic. Not only that! There were *xian* and *gui* and whole bunch of other things she wasn't equipped to deal with. \n\nThere was cultivation. That explained that angry girl's inhuman strength, and apparently her display of prowess was only the tip of the iceberg.\n\n\"Piz-dets,\" Jiaojiao muttered.\n\n*What was that?*\n\n\"Say, you seem to have overlooked something very important, Guang Qiu.\"\n\n*Guang Qiu?* The ball of light vibrated in agitation. *You are addressing me?*\n\n\"You are a ball of light and you refuse to disclose your name to the likes of I, so yes, Guang Qiu.\"\n\n*The nerve! I am far more than some ball of light!*\n\n\"Anyway, Guang Qiu,\" Jiaojiao continued. \"You seemed to have forgotten that an *entertainer* and an assassin have very different skill sets.\"\n\nThat's right. Bai Jing, the missing heroine, was an assassin. Not only was she an assassin, she was the supposedly the best of her kind, feared in the underworld of her original world as the embodiment of death. Her victims numerous enough to \"circle the globe once.\" Jiaojiao was too lazy to inspect the math on that claim.\n\n Trained in the art of killing from the tender age of seven, she could kill you with a knife, she could kill you a spoon, hell, she could probably kill with both her hands *and legs* tied behind her back. And not only was she good at killing people, she was trained in both western and eastern medicine. \n\nShe could kill with a needle, and she could similarly save lives with one too. At least, if the contents of the webnovel were to be believed.  \n\nA merciless reaper with a heart of gold. Beautiful, treacherous, and cold. Cold at least, when it came to people other than her paramour, Fei Chen.\n\nThe same Fei Chen who apparently stabbed her in the heart and forced her off a cliff for some mystical inheritance.\n\nYikes.\n\nAnyway, the recently murdered Bai Jing, understandably wrathful, had somehow revived in the body of also recently murdered Bai Xingyue, the same drowned body that Jiaojiao was currently wearing. And here was where the road split.\n\nBai Jing the assassin kicked Bai Xingwu and her two servants into next year,  laughing at their attempts to bully her. Then, she forced them to kowtow, beating their foreheads bruised and bloodied before sending them scurrying back whence they came, cradling broken wrists and broken egos.\n\nJiaojiao the influencer showed as much spine as a sea anenome and debased herself like the filthy mortal entertainer she was. \n\n*No, matter,* the ball of light said smoothly, *with me here, all your inadequacies will be immaterial.*\n\nJiaojiao gave a ball a thousand-yard stare and shuffled toward the bedroom exit, squeezing past the door barely hanging on by one hinge.\n\n*Where are you going?*\n\n\"This mortal has some mortal things to do.\"\n\n*What things can possible be more important than the mission?*\n\n\"Bathroom!\"\n\n*Bathroom?*\n\n\"It's called a bladder you disembodied simpleton.\"\n\nShe left the sputtering Guang Qiu to get upset over her directness, hobbling past a dusty room, equally sad as the one she'd just left, with old worn furniture and cobwebs. Jiaojiao quickly located the front door to the building, it wasn't hard, the mean trio hadn't bothered closing the doors after themselves. The pain in her leg was a persistent presence as she leaned against the cracked doorframe and peered outside. \n\nIn the midday light, a neglected courtyard came into view, weeds peeking out from between the flagstones. A half withered apricot tree twisted overhead, casting curled shadows on the walkway. Dead leaves filled the corners of the patchy walls, spotty with flaking limestone plaster and creeping moss. There was even a sizable hole in the wall directly across from her, large enough to stick her head through.  A second and third building, smaller than the main house stood off to the side, in an equal state of disrepair and entropy. A small pond with a wealth of duckweed and choked with clumps of algae completed the depressing scene.\n\nJiaojiao ignored all this in favor of the shabby outhouse in the far corner of the courtyard, also missing roof shingles and with a door that hung crookedly in its frame. \n\n*It'll be fine!* Jiaojiao pep-talked herself, *it will be like camping. We did that once, right?* \n\nIt had been an expensive company retreat with running water, yoga instructors, and h'orderves but *let's not think about that right this second.*\n\nGritting her teeth against the stabbing pain in her right-calf, she shuffled over. It was only about twenty meters but it felt like twenty miles.\n\nAt ten meters, Jiaojiao was already wrinkling her nose at the smell. Delightful. Her face grew ever more pinched with dread as she neared the source of the distinctive aroma. \n\n*It's fine. I'm fine. Everything's--*\n\nShe wrenched open the door and gagged on the stench.¬†\n\nAfter hesitating on the threshold for a good thirty seconds, silently choking on the smell, she finally gathered the remnants of her waning courage and hopped inside, shutting the door behind her. After a nerve-wracking ten seconds, fumbling with the unwieldy folds of her robes, she finished her business, then realized there was no toilet paper. She nearly died of shock on the spot.\n\nFinally, she ripped off a corner of her robes to finally put an end to the horrible affair and dashed outside as quickly as her gimp leg allowed.\n\n\"That's it,\" Jiaojiao announced, incoherent with disgust. \"I can't. Just no.\"\n\nShe drifted back inside the house, muttering to herself. \"Isn't it just dying? I can just do it again.\"\n\n*What are you talking about?* the ball of light floated over, emanating superiority.\n\nJiaojiao looked at it with the gaze of a man recently returned from the front-lines. \n\nBefore Jiaojiao could tear into the ball for sending her to this godforsaken era, a noise came from outside.\n\n\"Aiya! What happened here?\" A high voice cried. \"Young miss! Are you all right? Young miss!\"\n\nRapid footsteps, then a portly old woman dressed in gray robes came into view. Her face was plump with the beginnings of age-spots on her cheeks. Her wrinkled forehead creased with worry as she looked Jiaojiao up and down. \"Yueyue! Did that awful second young miss come by again? You're not hurt are you?\"\n\nThe old woman dropped her basket of vegetables, making tsking noises as she came up to take Jiaojiao's sleeves. \"Why are you wearing your good robe? Why is it ripped? Did the second miss do this?\" \n\n*These are the good robes?*\n\nJiaojiao tried to draw back, alarmed as the old woman took a hank of limp hair and folded it behind Jiaojiao's ear, but the old woman's grip was like iron. She was further dumbfounded when the woman *picked her up* by the elbows and deposited her onto the ruined *kang* not even batting an eye at the two mango-sized holes in the middle of the bed.\n\n\"Don't you worry, Yueyue, I harvested some good bamboo just the other day, you won't have to sleep on the floor tonight.\"\n\n*Sleep on the floor?* Jiaojiao echoed shrilly in her head. *You better fucking believe that's never happening.*\n\nJiaojiao spent the next twenty minutes watching the old woman bustle about, having been deposited onto three-legged stool like a doll. The old woman pulled out an old stone bucket from somewhere and placing it in the middle of the courtyard. She proceeded to light some coals on fire, turning her head away when it spat out plumes of foul smoke.\n\n\"I spent this month's stipend on some charcoal,\" the old woman told her cheerfully. \"You won't have to wear your padded jacket to sleep tonight.\"\n\nJiaojiao had no response to this delightful news.\n\nAs the old woman took out a dented copper pot and and cup of broken rice, Jiaojiao finally identified the old woman from the wealth of text swimming in her head. \n\n\"Cen Wei.\"\n\nThe old woman peered over curiously. \"What is it Yueyue? Are you feeling ill?\"\n\nJiaojiao forced out a smile. \"It's nothing.\"\n\n\"Yueyue! You're smiling!\" The old lady threw down a handful of wilted vegetables and scurried over, frowning in worry. \"You're smiling! Are you sure you're alright?\"\n\n*Damn, how miserable was this Yueyue that a smile would read as a red flag?*\n\nThe old woman fussed over Jiaojiao, turning her this way and that with her inhuman strength. Jiaojiao could only sit there and take it with her stick limbs and bum leg. She shot a pointed look at the ball of light floating off to the side, but it showed no reaction to her distress, seemingly content to watch her be manhandled. Jiaojiao was fast growing tired of being treated like a living doll by this old woman.\n\nAfter the mixture of broken rice and handful of cabbage leaf coagulated into a depressing looking gruel, the woman banked the charcoal fire and ushered Jiaojiao back into the main room. She plopped her onto a flat cushion that has seen better days, jolting a wince out of her as her leg brushed the floor at a bad angle.\n\nWhat followed was the worst meal Jiaojiao had ever had the displeasure of tasting. She hadn't had much expectation seeing the ingredients that had gone into the copper pot, but...\n\n\"Are these worm holes?\" Jiaojiao asked, a tremor in her voice, holding aloft a boiled cabbage leaf with mismatched chopsticks.\n\n\"They were only two bits of copper at market, I got two whole baskets!\" Cen Wei said, yellowed teeth on display with a wide smile. \"We can have vegetables all every meal this week!\"\n\nJiaojiao took one look at that expectant face, seemingly searching for praise, and laughed a little hysterically. \"I'm full,\" she said finally, placing down her bowl on the uneven tea table, the surface pockmarked from years of abuse and missing half its mother-of-pearl inlays.\n\n\"How can you be full?\" Cen Wei asked in disapproval. \"You barely ate.\"\n\n\"Why don't you eat instead?\" Jiaojiao suggested.\n\nThis was apparently the wrong thing to say as Cen Wei's expression fell.\n\n\"Have I done something wrong, miss?\" Cen Wei asked in a wobbly voice, her creased hand coming up to wipe the tears collecting in her eyes. \"I know it's not much, but I tried my best to come up with this meal.\"\n\n\"I'm just not hungry,\" Jiaojiao deflected. \"You did nothing wrong.\"\n\n\"Those bastard kitchen hands cut off our daily meals again! They are too much! I almost thought I would have to beg in the streets so we wouldn't starve!\" Cen Wei slammed a fist on the table. The legs groaned in protest and another inlay popped off the surface, but she paid it no mind, too caught up in her diatribe. \n\n\"Or are you not feeling well because...\" she gave Jiaojiao a commiserating look. \"I didn't want to speak of it, because I know you must feel ashamed, but is this because of what happened yesterday?\" Cen Wei asked with sniff. \"My poor Yueyue! Humiliated in front of half the capital!\"\n\n\"It's not--\"\n\n\"It's that awful first miss!\" Cen Wei said with a wail. \"She set you up! She knew you didn't want to go to the palace feast, but she forced you into the carriage anyway! I know how shy you are about your birthmark! How could you possibly have gone to that feast of your own will!\"\n\nJiaojiao sat back and watched the old woman degenerate into a fretful mess of tears and indignation on behalf of the absent Yueyue. \n\n*So noisy,* Guang Qiu finally spoke.\n\n\"So fake,\" Jiaojiao said.\n\n\"What was that, Yueyue?\" Cen Wei said, looking at her sharply.\n\n\"Nothing, nothing,\" Jiaojiao said with a thin smile. \"I was just saying how I don't feel like eating because of what happened yesterday.\"\n\nCen Wei stared at Jiaojiao for a long time, expression clouded. \"Yes, Yueyue must still be in shock, after all you almost died in that pond.\"\n\nJiaojiao forced herself to eat the thin gruel, nibbling on a few mouthfuls of bitter cabbage leaves before the appalling meal finally drew to a close. Cen Wei didn't urge her to eat more, taking away the half-full bowl. \n\nShe murmured some excuse about being tired, then excused herself to her room, maneuvering the broken door back into its frame with a grunt of effort.\n\n\"Guang Qiu,\" Jiaojiao said, when she was sure Cen Wei wasn't listening in.\n\n*What?* the ball asked, having retired to the inner chambers with her.\n\n\"Don't tell me you didn't notice?\" Jiaojiao asked incredulously.\n\n*Notice what?*\n\n\"Are you blind? There's something wrong with Cen Wei.\"","lastmodified":"2022-04-08T11:06:54.271654654Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/Chapter04-Cen-Wei-the-Suspicious":{"title":"Chapter 01-Cen Wei the Suspicious","content":"*What are you doing?*\n\nJiaojiao ignored the ball of light in favor of peeking through one of the many holes in the front window. The old woman, Cen Wei, was cheerfully puttering about in the courtyard. Jiaojiao watched with morbid curiosity as the woman went into one of the other buildings and came out with a wooden bucket, a shovel and a length of cloth tied around her face. The woman disappeared into the horrific outhouse Jiaojiao was still suffering ongoing flashbacks about with her implements.\n\n\"What is *she* doing?\" Jiaojiao asked. \n\n*You are behaving oddly. I see nothing wrong with the old woman?*\n\nJiaojiao didn't reply, busy going over what she knew of Cen Wei from the godawful text in her mind. Cen Wei didn't have much of a presence in The Cold Prince Loves Me Dearly. The sum of her parts was less than five thousand words, a pitiful count in comparison to characters such as Bai Xingwu who had upwards of sixty thousand words describing her interactions with Bai Jing.\n\nCen Wei was the wet-nurse of Bai Xingyue's mother-- well, her supposed mother, Mu Haoru-- lets not get into that mess right now. But she was a devoted servant from the past generation and had taken care of Bai Xingyue all her life. Despite this, she didn't show doubt at Bai Xingyue's sudden change in personality when Bai Jing took over. Instead, citing her change as her young miss having \"finally grown up.\" She was a sycophantic presence next to the transmigrated Bai Jing, never saying a word against this new version of her young miss. Even curiouser, she never once doubted Bai Jing's strength, despite Bai Xingyue being a lifelong cripple with no martial training. From beginning to end, Cen Wei was described as a loyal if somewhat dull-witted servant.\n\nCurious.\n\nCen Wei came out of the outhouse five minutes later, bucket full of... Jiaojiao surpressed her churning stomach. \"You seriously don't see it? This old woman is *suss*.\"\n\n*What?*\n\n\"She's a servant. If she truly cared for her master then why was this body still wearing the wet clothes after nearly drowning? Isn't it common sense that a person should change clothes after getting them wet? Yet this poor girl lay in soggy clothes all night. There's something wrong with your book.\"\n\n*So the servant is lazy, it doesn't mean the book is wrong.*\n\nAnother thin smile. \"Sure hon. But I haven't even gotten to this old woman's real odd points. I mean, just look at her.\"\n\nThe was a pause as the ball took an irritated glance at the old woman, now swishing the defiled shovel in the courtyard pond. *I see nothing odd about her.*\n\n\"Look at her, and look at this body,\" Jiaojiao held up a feeble wrist. \"What loyal servant is that plump while her master starves? I call bullshit.\"\n\n*...perhaps it's simply a difference of physique?*\n\nJiaojiao was beginning to think that Guang Qiu wasn't very bright despite his luminous appearance. \"Yeah? And what about these hands? Just look at these nails!\"\n\nA chipped nail was thrust in front of Guang Qiu like a piece of case-breaking evidence.\n\n*...what about them?*\n\n\"Um, hello? She's supposed to be the master? Why do her hands look worse than the old lady's? You don't get hands like these unless you're doing hard labor, like handwashing clothes in the dead of winter or something.\"\n\nThere was a considering air emanating from the ball. *Perhaps you have a point.*\n\nJiaojiao smiled--\n\n*But that still doesn't mean the book was wrong. There's nothing here that says that the old woman wasn't simply avoiding her duties. It doesn't mean she is disloyal at heart.* The ball insisted, though it didn't seem quite as certain as before.\n\nJiaojiao rolled her eyes. \"I haven't even mentioned the most damning piece of evidence. This one is even backed up by your precious book.\"\n\n*What evidence?*\n\n\"Bai Xingyue's poison,\" Jiaojiao said with a smirk. \"This girl is being poisoned right? Where do you think it's coming from?\"\n\n*I don't follow.*\n\n\"Do I have to spell it out for you? Are you an idiot? Do you even have two brain cells to rub together?\"\n\n*You dare insult my intelligence--*\n\n\"Cen Wei herself said the kitchens are withholding rations. Where is the poison coming from?\" Jiaojiao spoke as if to a very slow child.\n\nThere was a long, excruciating pause.\n\n*The poison comes from Head Wife Zhang. It says so in the book.*\n\n\"Yeah, but how is it getting to Bai Xingyue, you dumb brick?\"\n\nAnother sullen pause. *Very well, perhaps your suspicions are not totally groundless.*\n\n\"Good lord, he can be taught. Speaking of poison,\" Jiaojiao said. \"How exactly do you plan on ridding me of it? It'll be hilarious if after all this talk the body simply keels over. Keels over again, I mean.\"\n\n*Because you are an entertainer with no training in the medical arts, I will have to find an alternative way to cure you of the poison currently plaguing you.* \n\n\"Sure, whatever.\"\n\nAs they spoke, Cen Wei had disappeared from view with her bucket of... leavings. Perhaps this would lead to a marginal improvement in smell, though Jiaojiao wasn't getting her hopes up. She wasn't too curious about where those leavings were going to end up. Nope.\n\n\"Anyway, Guang Qiu--\" Jiaojiao ignored the ball as it bristled at its moniker \"--if I learn to cultivate, does that I no longer have to use the bathroom?\"\n\n*What does that have to do with anything?*\n\n\"I don't expect you to understand, since you are but a disembodied orb, but this matter has a direct relation to my sanity, so please answer the question.\"\n\n*...once you reach Jindan stage, you will be able to exist solely on spirit energy, thus negating the need to defecate.*\n\n\"Sweet. I'll keep that in mind.\"\n\n*Perhaps we should now speak of your next move. Given that you're not capable of curing yourself, you'll need to find a doctor. You must fix your leg as soon as possible if you are to keep up with the timeline in the book.*\n\n\"Ugh, do we have to talk about this now?\" Jiaojiao protested. \"I need a bath and a *real* change of clothes, where can I find those? And I haven't even seen what I look like yet! Am I ugly? This body is pretty ugly, right?\"\n\nThe ball seemed out of patience as it began to emanate an unseen pressure.\n\n\"Don't emote me! Like you can understand when you don't even have a body. Why don't we switch places and I can be the judgmental presence hovering over you instead?\"\n\n*Don't waste your time wishing for the impossible, mortal!*\n\n\"Whatever, I--\" Jiaojiao paused. \"Did you see that?\"\n\n*What is it now?*\n\nJiaojiao stared intently at the hole in the courtyard wall. She could have sworn she saw a face peeking into the yard. Before she could speak again, Cen Wei barged into the room, lugging a large wooden tub. Jiaojiao's eyes lit up.\n\n\"Nevermind, it's nothing.\"\n\nWhat followed was a highly uncomfortable bath with lukewarm water, supervised by an overzealous servant that insisted on scrubbing her from head to toe with a sponge that felt more like a pumice stone. Jiaojiao tried several times to shoo Cen Wei away, unable to forget that those same hands scrubbing her body were engaged in far fouler chores less than an hour ago, and she had yet to see Cen Wei break out an antibacterial soap, but the old servant was not to be deterred. \n\nShe was far less concerned about her own nakedness. Jiaojiao didn't feel modesty, she after all, was not in her own body, and even if she were, she had long had modesty drummed out of her by her profession as an \"entertainer.\" Jiaojiao finally got a closer look at her new body, and she did not like it one bit. \n\nBai Xingyue was distressingly skinny, akin to pictures of starving refuges Jiaojiao had seen on the news or in documentaries. There were strange red striations around her joints. Curious, she'd pushed on them and felt a spreading numbness. She wanted answers, but Guang Qiu had long excused themselves and Jiaojiao couldn't very well ask Cen Wei the Poisoner, as she caught the servant looking at her with questioning eyes.\n\n\"Is something wrong, Yueyue?\"\n\n\"Nothing, just cold,\" Jiaojiao said, ducking her head to hide a repulsed shiver.\n\nCen Wei spread a few crumbs of inferior quality *zao dou*, or \"bath beans\" that gave off a weak lather. Jiaojiao was very interested in the ancient soap, given that she was a sucker for vegan beauty products, but seeing Cen Wei's strange look as she handled the soap sent her inner curiosity deflating. \n\nAfter the awkward affair, Cen Wei left to dispose of the bathwater while Jiaojiao changed into clothes she reluctantly deemed tolerable, if not acceptable. Homeless chic was *never* a good look in her mind, but what could you do when you were the disgraced and bullied second miss of a cold, impersonal clan?\n\nGuang Qiu reappeared the moment Jiaojiao was dressed, sending her impatient vibes. *You mortals are so troublesome.*\n\n\"Yes, yes, spare me the lecture about mortal filth,\" Jiaojiao said.\n\n\"Who are you talking to, Yueyue?\" Cen Wei asked with a concerned frown, craning her head around the broken door. \n\n\"Nobody, just talking myself.\"\n\n*You don't have to speak aloud,* Guang Qiu said with condescension. *I can hear your thoughts.*\n\n\"No you can't,\" Jiaojiao said. \"If you could, you'd be far angrier with me.\"\n\n*I can hear thoughts you direct at me.* \n\n*Can you hear this, sad rave?* Jiaojiao thought cautiously, not attempting to \"send\" thoughts.\n\n*Brainless nightlight,* she thought with slightly more intent.\n\n*Discount disco,* she tried again when Guang Qui showed no reaction.\n\n*What,* if Guang Qiu had teeth, Jiaojiao didn't doubt she would have heard them grinding that very moment. *Is a disco.*\n\nJiaojiao's reply was interrupted as Cen Wei returned with a comb with missing teeth and a battered bronze mirror. \"Yueyue, come here, let me dry your hair.\"\n\nJiaojiao dutifully sat on the ground by the low table and Cen Wei placed the dented mirror in front of her. It looked much like something that should be on exhibit at a museum, complete with an ages worth of scratches and shedding teal flakes of oxidation. The servant had a strange glint in her eye and Jiaojiao didn't have long to wonder why as she got a look at the face in the mirror.\n\nBai Jing in the webnovel had been described as a world-stopping beauty, both before her death and as her reincarnation in Bai Xingyue's body. The face in the mirror however, lacked any sort of grace or enviable qualities so extoled by the author. There was no smooth skin, or brilliant eyes shining with determination or haughtiness inherent to those confident in their own worth. There was no lustrous black hair or red ruby lips. No oval-shaped face, or long, curled lashes, like that of a butterfly's wing.\n\nThere reflected in the bronze was a small, weak girl, a large, muddy-red stain marred the left half of her face, covering most of her forehead, cutting down across the middle of her face, lashing her nosebridge and over her left eye. Most of her left cheek was similarly discolored and the stain went on to cover most of her ear and extend into her hairline. The mark was a deep maroon, mottled, and had strange squiggly marks like veins.\n\nJiaojiao raised a hand and placed in on the mark, deep in thought. Cen Wei spoke by her ear. \"Don't be sad, miss, you are still very beautiful in my heart.\"\n\n*If you knew she would be sad, why put the mirror in front of her, you sadistic old biddy.* If Jiaojiao still had doubts about Cen Wei's attitude about her charge, they were thoroughly dispelled in this second. She actually sounded happy at the thought that the young girl would be distressed by her own ugliness.\n\nUnfortunately, Jiaojiao was here, and Jiaojiao, though self-confessed to be incurably vain, wasn't stupid enough to confuse her own face with the face of the stranger in the mirror. And more importantly, wasn't Bai Jing able to dispel this mark from her face with relative ease? It hadn't even taken her five chapters in fact.\n\nBut what did Guang Qiu think of all this? Jiaojiao shot it a meaningful glance, but it hovered there, unaffected by the scene of an old woman tormenting a young girl with her own inadequacies. Whatever, she evidently expected too much from that idiot. \n\n*Oy, what do you think of the old woman?* Jiaojiao prodded.\n\n*What is there to say? Isn't she being kind by combing your hair? She is simply doing her job as your servant.*\n\nRiiiight. *Sure hon. Whatever you say.*\n\nCen Wei carefully, lovingly even, combed through the tangles of Jiaojiao's thin locks. Given malnutrition and lack of modern hair products, or any hair products really, the girl's hair wasn't in great condition. Jiaojiao grabbed a handful of split ends and grimaced. Nothing short of a haircut could save this mess, unfortunately, if the ancient standards of the world were consistent, then it would be considered an unfilial crime to cut ones hair. \n\nNot that something like that was going to stop Jiaojiao from doing *what needed to be done.*\n\nJiaojiao took another look at the face in the mirror. Cen Wei had started humming behind her, a cheerful tune that grated on her nerves and she did her best to ignore her. The face had potential, Jiaojiao admitted. The book author wasn't completely talking out of her ass when she described Bai Jing as a beauty to end all beauties. The bone structure was good, with delicate, high cheekbones, and underneath the mark, the skin was even in spite of the illusion given by the squiggling, veinlike marks. \n\nYes, she could work with this. Given her occupation, she would be embarrassed if she couldn't work with such material. Even if the little girl *had* been plain, it wouldn't have made a differences A good diet, some exercise-- after that damned leg was fixed-- and some make-up magic, what heart-stopping beauty couldn't she make?\n\nBesides, the mark wasn't natural to begin with, not a birthmark as said in rumors, but a poison, courtesy of Head Wife Zhang. Some more inter-house drama she wasn't looking forward to navigating but...\n\n*What are you going to do about the poison?* Jiaojiao asked Guang Qiu in her head, prodding the mark. *Bai Jing had that magical inheritance to help her, but I don't have that, do I?*\n\nGuang Qiu paused, having realized he had overlooked yet another, very important detail.\n\n*That's... Guang Qiu stalled, apparently at a loss.\n\nShe shook her head, wincing as Cen Wei's comb caught on a difficult knot.\n\n*I'll think of something.* \n\nJiaojiao almost felt sorry for the dumb thing. It was clearly baling water out of a sinking ship.","lastmodified":"2022-04-08T11:06:54.271654654Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/Chapter05-Bai-Jings-Artifact":{"title":"Chapter 05-Bai Jing's Artifact","content":"Cen Wei soon finished combing Jiaojiao's hair and retreated with the dented mirror, smile a touch smugger than before. Jiaojiao didn't care to speculate on the old woman's inner thoughts, as poisonous as they must be.\n\nGuang Qiu went back to its silence, content to float there, unassuming, at least, until Cen Wei came back, arms laden with bamboo strips.\n\n\"What's this?\" Cen Wei suddenly said with surprise.\n\nJiaojiao looked over to see the old woman holding a delicately carved bangle in her thick palm. It was made of a shimmery pear wood and seemed far too small to fit on her stout wrist.\n\n*That's--!*\n\nCen Wei turned the bracelet this way and that, giving Jiaojiao an inquisitive look. \"Where did this come from?\"\n\n*If my suspicions are correct...* thought Jiaojiao.\n\n*Grab it!* Guang Qiu suddenly screamed in her mind, loud enough to cause Jiaojiao to jolt in alarm.\n\n\"That's mine,\" Jiaojiao said instead with a careful expression. \"Can I have it back, please?\"\n\nCen Wei gave her a considering stare, hands rubbing the exquisite bracelet between her hands. \"This looks expensive.\"\n\n\"It's really not,\" Jiaojiao said. \"It's fake. I got it for a few coppers.\"\n\nThe furrow between the servant's brows deepened. \"When did you buy it? You never leave the estate.\"\n\n*Woops.* \"I asked another servant to buy it for me.\"\n\nCen Wei didn't look like she believed her. \"Where did you get the money? Who did you ask?\"\n\n*This servant really dared.* \"Does it matter where I got the money? Now give it to me.\" Jiaojiao held out her hand, palm up.\n\n\"Yueyue!\" Cen Wei looked scandalized. \"How can a young lady speak like that?\"\n\nThe bracelet disappeared  into her sleeve. \"Don't worry, I will keep this safe for you. You know how forgetful you are! Wouldn't want you to lose such a pretty thing! You know how things sometimes disappear around you.\"\n\n*Aided largely in part by a certain servant, I would imagine.* Jiaojiao thought sardonically.\n\n*What are you sitting there for?!* Guang Qiu screamed. *Just take it from her, she's but an old woman!*\n\nJiaojiao stood.\n\n*Wait!* \n\nJiaojiao smirked and sat back down.\n\n*You can't get into a conflict with her,* Guang Qiu said, sounding annoyed. *It would derail the plot too much.*\n\n\"I must say, you are behaving very oddly!\" Cen Wei scolded. \"I know you must not be very happy after humiliating yourself, but this is no reason to misbehave!\"\n\n*You will have to take it from her unnoticed,* Guang Qiu said wearily. *You cannot allow your relationship with her to sour.*\n\n*The woman is already poisoning me,* Jiaojiao laughed inwardly. *Could the relationship be worse?*\n\nCen Wei had gone back to stripping the broken bamboo slats from the kang, apparently not feeling even a moment of shame for brazenly stealing from her mistress.\n\n*This impudent servant!* Guang Qiu roared, floating around the old woman and swirling in agitation.\n\nIn shortly less than an hour, Cen Wei had patched the bed, deft fingers flying over the frame, evidently used to performing such repairs. Jiaojiao had to wonder how often Bai Xingwu had ruined Bai Xingyue's bed specifically for Cen Wei to become so adept.\n\n*We cannot allow that old woman to get away with that bracelet. It is Bai Jing's artifact!*\n\n*I figured. You wouldn't go batshit over some random piece of jewelry.* Jiaojiao bounced carefully on the newly repaired *kang*. *Speaking of which, why is the bracelet here? If it belongs to Bai Jing, then doesn't that mean she showed up after all?*\n\nGuang Qiu was silent. Digesting this piece of news. \n\n*Unless of course, you're wrong and that bracelet is just an ordinary piece of jewelry.*\n\n*No, I cannot be wrong about this,* Guang Qiu said. *I don't know why it is here, but this is good news for you. You will be able to heal your leg and cure your poison with that bracelet.*\n\nBai Jing's bracelet was far from as simple as its appearance suggested. Her mother, the latest heir to an ancient mystical clan, famous for their skills in Chinese medicine, had gifted it to Bai Jing shortly before being murdered by her husband, Bai Jing's father, for control of the Bai family-- not to be confused with the Shaofu realm Bai Family. Anyway, it was all Very Sad.\n\nBai Jing hid away the bracelet, having been told by her mother that it harbored a very special secret. All through the years she was consigned to a death camp by her own father, she never spoke of it, despite his repeated attempts to persuade the answer out of her. After all, Bai Jing had been the sole witness to her mothers murder at her father's hands. \n\nBai Jing could only watch helplessly as her father took control of her mother's clan and all its businesses. Could only look as her father swiftly married his secret mistress, even bringing home a half-sister the same age as her. Could only keep to herself and plot revenge in the dark while her half-sister lived in the light, taking everything that should have been hers.\n\nShe guarded against this den of vipers all her life, building up her own strength, hoping one day to burst out with a revenge worthy of the history books. She honed her skills killing her targets, each time imagining her own father's face as she cut them down, even as every move she made was at the discretion of *that man*. She spent every free moment learning about medicine, both western and eastern, not wanting to shame her clan's legacy, planning for the day when she would wrench control of the clan from her father's cold dead hands.\n\nWho knew that half-sister would send her lover to seduce Bai Jing in a strange bid for the rumored inheritance of the mystical Bai Family, causing Bai Jing to trip up in the dumbest way possible.\n\nHaving lost her life in such a hackneyed, cliched manner, Bai Jing was luckily saved by her mother's artifact. Inside slept a celestial tiger, which whisked her soul away to the world of Shaofu, where she was reborn as the crippled girl, Bai Xingyue.\n\nThe bracelet was a magical item that harbored a secret space inside that defied common sense. It had various features such as the ability to store food indefinitely with no chance of it degrading. Plants grew faster in this pocket dimension as well, and there was even a luxurious pavilion with a library of secret martial arts texts. Plants grew faster in the soil, an advantage that Bai Jing exploited throughout her career dominating the world of Shaofu. She would use the space to nurture medicinal plants, supplying her alchemy with an endless crop of ingredients. Not to mention there was a celestial tiger that would become Bai Jing's willing lackey and body guard during her more vulnerable days.\n\nIn other words, the space was an indispensable part of Bai Jing's strength.\n\n*Tonight, when she has gone to bed, you will sneak into her room--*\n\n*Oh sure,* Jiaojiao said. *Just watch me, I'll be shadow itself with this bum leg.*\n\n*Bai Jing would--*\n\nJiaojiao massaged her forehead. *Not Bai Jing, Hello? Have you been paying attention at all?*\n\nGuang Qiu's light levels dimmed, and the room simmered in its discontent. *You will get that bracelet one way or another. You must. Or I will get rid of you.*\n\nJiaojiao covered her mouth as a yawn forced tears from her eyes. \"Can I do it later? I'm tired. Besides, she said she's going out for errands and it's not like this body is capable of running her down.\"\n\nThe ball's angry reply was lost as Jiaojiao laid back on the *kang* and fell asleep in a daze. \n\n*Isekai. Why did I have to be isekai'ed?* Jiaojiao's tired mind spiraled, confused. *Clearly I haven't even brushed the bumper of a white truck or crossed paths with an insane slasher? Why me? Isn't this sort of bullshit supposed to happen to virgin salarymen?*\n\nJiaojiao hadn't had a perfect life, but it was damn close. She was rich, famous, and admired by 13 million fans at the lastest count. She didn't lack for anything. She was a trust-fund baby for fucks sake, she didn't have any of the hallmarks typical of isekai victims. She wasn't disastified with the status quo. She had no outstanding traumas. She wasn't bullied, aside from some of the more poisonous voices denoucing her as shallow, fake, etc, she hadn't encountered much negativity at all. In fact, she was often praised for being young and successful--though some bitter voices would attribute all her accomplishments to her background as the young heir to the huge MEI conglomerate.\n\nShe had friends. Well, maybe they weren't quite as genuine as some, but she had a wide circle of acquaintances who were (somewhat) invested in her wellbeing. And she had...\n\nDevika. She had forgotten Devika. She had to ask Guang Qiu if she was okay. If whatever killed her had killed Devika too, then where was she?\n\nHow had she died anyway? She hadn't had the chance to ask Guang Qiu in all the chaotic aftermath of her sudden transmigration.\n\n*Isn't transmigration trendy?* Jiaojiao thought, somewhat hysterically to herself. *And I pride myself on being trendy, right? Maybe it's a little tired, but people still like reading about it, right?*\n\nThe kang creaked as Jiaojiao's body turned fitfully, her mind unable to rest as she fell deeper into dreams. \n\n*She looks out the broken window, rubble crumbling over the edges of the sill. Dust lingered in the cracks and crevices between the stones. Ivy trails curled and spun over the walls. She sees a shimmering valley in the distance, but she knows there is nothing there for her. She turns away and treads familiar steps down the corridor, shattered stone litters the path but she steps over them with practiced footwork.*\n\n*Checkered sunlight streams across the hall. Dusty footprints chase her steps. Not a sound is made. She comes to a door, half open, half closed. She pushes past and walks inside into a room with only one occupant. He is waiting for her, as he always is.*\n\n*I died today. But you weren't there.*\n\n*He doesn't speak. He never does. But he smiles.*\n\nJiaojiao woke in a start as someone shook her awake.\n\n\"Yueyue! Did you sleep well?\"\n\nJiaojiao held her head, still half lost in dreams. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\"Yueyue,\" Cen Wei shook her again, rougher this time. \"It's time for dinner.\"\n\nGuang Qiu popped into existence by her ear just as Jiaojiao was about to take her first bite.\n\n*Don't eat it. There's poison!*\n\nJiaojiao ignored it and took a difficult mouthful of worm-eaten cabbage.\n\nThe ball seemed shocked into silence. For all of two seconds. Then it screamed. *What are you doing?! Did you not hear me, mortal? Poison! I said there is poison!*\n\n*I heard you.* Jiaojiao shot back irritably. *What do you think the old woman would do if I refused to eat? Didn't you say I had to keep a good relationship with her for The Plot? Besides, this body is on the verge of keeling over from starvation. If you want me to be of any use, don't I need the strength?*\n\n*You are eating poison,* the ball retorted. *It's already killing you. I did a scan of your body as you slept--*\n\n*Um, invasive much?*\n\n*And the body is not long for this world if the rate of poison is not stemmed.*\n\n*Well, the body has been poisoned all its life,* Jiaojiao reasoned. *One more meal won't kill it.*\n\nGuang Qiu grumbled some more, but didn't refute this.\n\nJiaojiao choked down another half bowl of gruel before she couldn't force herself to go on, honestly she was proud that she had done as well as she had.\n\n*This has been the worst day of my life,* Jiaojiao told the ball with a dreary resignation as she watched Cen Wei rinse out the bowl in a bucket of well water-- not the same bucket she had used earlier that day thankfully. \n\n*You are too pampered,* the ball sneered. *You call this much suffering? How soft you are.*\n\nJiaojiao didn't argue. She was indeed a pampered, soft, and delicate existence. The worst thing she'd eaten prior to today had been a slightly sour yogurt she'd left in the fridge too long.\n\n\"Cen Wei,\" Jiaojiao said suddenly. \"Can I see a doctor about my leg?\"\n\nThis entreaty was enough for Cen Wei to drop a bowl. It shattered in half on the cobblestones and the pieces wobbled back and forth, emitting sounds like jeering laughter.\n\n\"What?\" Cen Wei, eyes wide. \"You want to fix your leg?\"\n\n\"Is something wrong?\" Jiaojiao asked. \n\n\"You can't!\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"There--\" Cen Wei licked her lips. \"There's no money.\"\n\nJiaojiao didn't speak.\n\n\"Besides, why would you want to fix your leg? It's been so long, miss. I'm afraid...\"\n\nThe rest went unspoken, but the implication was there. That the leg was too far gone to fix. That she should be content to spend the rest of her life a cripple. Cen Wei's deliberately bitter smile was ripe with untold sympathy.\n\n*Hey she makes a good point,* Jiaojiao said to Guang Qiu. *We're broke.*\n\nJiaojiao could almost hear the ball's scream of frustration.\n\n*We will cross that bridge when we come to it.* \n\nJiaojiao shrugged, then hobbled toward the outhouse.\n\n\"Do you need help, young miss?\" Cen Wei said, relief evident in her voice that her master had dropped the subject.\n\n\"I'll be fine,\" Jiaojiao said.\n\nGuang Qiu had excused itself the second Jiaojiao made moves toward the outhouse, no doubt afraid of mortal filth. But Jiaojiao didn't enter the outhouse. Instead, she hesitated for a long, long moment before picking up the three-foot long shovel leaning against the side, expression fraught with distress.\n\nShe hefted the smooth handle, trying her damndest to ignore the stench wafting off the rusted iron head. Flecks of... matter remained despite its bath earlier in the day. *Don't think about it, don't think about it.*\n\nCen Wei was still scrubbing dishes when Jiaojiao quietly came up behind her and whacked her in the head with the shovel. She fell forward, but caught herself on the edge of the bucket in front of her. Expression livid, she turned in time to catch the second hit with her forehead. \n\n\"Yueyue!\" She screamed, holding her face. Jiaojiao hit her again. It took five hits before the old woman finally slumped over into unconciousness.\n\nJiaojiao frowned, looking at the old woman collapsed facedown on the ground, then the shovel. \"What the hell is her head made of?\"\n\nGuang Qiu chose this moment to pop back into existence. *Mortal! What have you done!?*","lastmodified":"2022-04-08T11:06:54.271654654Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/Chapter06-The-Impasse":{"title":"Chapter 06-The Impasse","content":"Jiaojiao tossed the shovel aside with revulsion and wiped her stinging hands on Cen Wei's gray robes, paying no mind to Guang Qiu's enraged screams ringing in her mind.\n\n*Mortal! Didn't I say not to get in conflict with the old woman? Why did you attack her, you imbecile?!*\n\n*Sometimes I really do wonder if you have two brain cells to rub together, or whether you have braincells at all,* Jiaojiao retorted as she flipped the woman around with difficulty. She summoned all eighty-five pounds of leverage, sweat beading on her brow. *Perhaps you don't have a brain at all in that child's nightlight you call a body.*\n\n*Now what will happen to the fateline?* Guang Qiu seemed to be mostly talking to itself. *It's already bad enough that the scene with Bai Xingwu didn't go as intended!*\n\nJiaojiao rifled in the the woman's sleeves, but came up empty. *The bracelet isn't in her sleeves.* She informed Guang Qiu.\n\nA small bout of distressed silence. *Then go look for it! Doesn't she live in the other hovel over there?*\n\n*I can't just leave her here. What if she wakes up and comes after me?*\n\nGuang Qiu's grumbling reached a deafening crescendo as Jiaojiao ventured into the storehouse, the third building in the courtyard. She squinted in the low light of the setting sun and located a coil of moldy rope on a low shelf and sneezed when picking it up raised a small cloud of dust. Waving a hand in front of her face, she retreated with the heavy length of hemp rope, most likely reserved for roof repairs.\n\nShe spent the next ten to fifteen minutes securing Cen Wei's prone form, binding her arms close to her body and tying her legs together. She was thankful Bai Xingyue's courtyard was deserted, not knowing how she would explain herself should someone stumble onto the scene of her binding her unconscious servant.\n\n*This is not good,* Guang Qiu fretted. *What of the plot?*\n\n*For real? You should just accept that the plot had been miscarried the moment you decided to yeet me into this body,* Jiaojiao said, tying off the last the rope and clapping the filth off her hands. *Besides, we would have had to make a move against her sooner or later.*\n\n*I fail to see your reasoning. Bai Jing managed to keep an amiable relationship with the old woman, why couldn't you do the same?*\n\nJiaojiao was once again reminded that Guang Qiu wasn't the most farsighted of beings. *My guess is that Cen Wei was always rotten, but when Bai Jing showed up, she frightened Cen Wei into hiding her true nature when she beat up Bai Xingwu.*\n\n*So this is your fault!* The ball cried.\n\n*Hey, don't try to blame this on me. You're the one who put me here knowing I was but an \"entertainer,\" what exactly did you expect? That I would subdue them with my eyelash curlers?*\n\n*I still think it would have been better to sneak into her room--*\n\n*God, you just never quit! Even if I somehow managed to get the bracelet from her, what then? You saw her attitude. She would have likely detained us if we tried to leave. How would we get this leg fixed if we were confined to the courtyard? Even with the magic bracelet, I have no medical training. You expect me to fix this leg myself? And I highly doubt she would have been kind enough to invite a doctor. Besides... if my thoughts are correct...*\n\nJiaojiao once again turned a deaf ear to Guang Qiu's complaints as she pushed open the door to the servant's quarters. She thought she would be met with more depressing sights of decrepitude and poverty, but she was surprised to find Cen Wei's room to be in good condition-- at least compared to the rooms she'd spend the day in.\n\n*Tsk, this old woman sure had double standards,* Jiaojiao laughed as she took in the fluffy covers on the servant's *kang*. They weren't silk, like the ones on Bai Xingyue's bed, but at least the cotton wasn't half-eaten by moths or damp with pond water. The space was simple, but the furniture was in good repair, with a minimal amount of wear. Though of simpler make than the furniture in Bai Xingyue's quarters, they were at least not on the verge of falling apart with a slight bump.\n\nBai Xingyue really had lived an unjust life. Even her servant lived better than her. The ceiling didn't even have as many missing roof tiles. Jiaojiao even wondered if Cen Wei had misappropriated some of her mistresses roofing tiles for her own abode.\n\nThe covers were turned over as Jiaojiao searched for the thing she suspected was secreted away by Cen Wei.\n\n*Found it,* Jiaojiao said with a smile.\n\n*Well done, mortal, you found the artifact?*\n\n*No,* Jiaojiao held up the embroidered pouch, heavy and clinking in her hands. *Cash.*\n\n*You imbecile, how can this mortal pittance compare with the magical space--*\n\n*Hey idiot? Do you think doctors work for free? I'm guessing subsidized healthcare isn't a thing here.*\n\nA sullen hum. *What of the artifact?*\n\nJiaojiao turned over the rest of Cen Wei's items, but unfortunately the bracelet was nowhere to be found.\n\n*My guess is that the old woman pawned it this afternoon when she left. She really didn't waste any time. Some of the silver here is what she got in return,* Jiaojiao bounced the heavy pouch in her hands.\n\n*That old wretch! Now we have to waste more time tracking it down.* Guang Qiu cried. *I've a mind to do away with her!*\n\nJiaojiao smiled. *Do away?*\n\n*Yes,* the ball said to itself. *If she remains, it will be more of a problem. Go on, you've already done the damage when you decided to create a hostile relationship with her. Just go out and... hit her a few more times. You won't even have to risk your life.*\n\n*I'm not killing someone,* Jiaojiao said.\n\n*What?!* Guang Qiu drew back, as if the declaration against murder was somehow offensive. *What do you mean?*\n\n*I'm not a murderer,* Jiaojiao said. *You're not going to convince me to kill someone.*\n\n*You already hit her, what difference does it make if you hit her again?*\n\n*Uh, loads. I'm not going to get into this debate with you.*\n\n*This is a ridiculous conversation.*\n\n*Wow! Something we can agree on!*\n\n*If you hope to survive in this world, you will have to get over your squeamishness. You can't avoid killing forever. Bai Jing would have done it without even blinking.*\n\n*I'm getting really sick of hearing about Bai Jing. If she's so great, why isn't she here? Why am I stuck with her problems? Why am I stuck here with you?*\n\n*Don't forget, mortal, I am the sole reason you live and breath! You cannot defy me!*\n\n*Oh yeah? Go ahead, smite me. Just punish me for refusing to kill some defenseless old woman.*\n\nGuang Qiu didn't move.\n\n*You can't, can you? For all your blustering you can't do jack. If you could, you would have punished me already for not listening to you earlier.*\n\n*Mortal...*\n\n*This mortal doesn't have to do anything she doesn't want to. And she doesn't want to kill. So seriously, fuck off.*\n\n*Mortal, you will think twice before crossing me!* The ball warned.\n\n*I already have. And I don't think you're that much at all,* Jiaojiao scoffed. *You haven't done a thing to me since I woke up but scream at me to do things. And for what? With the threat of death? Newsflash, buddy! I'm already dead!*\n\n*You are alive right now.*\n\n*No, I'm pretty sure I'm fucking dead, and this is hell, with scenarios engineered just to torture me. No running water, no internet, no take-out, and everyone, EVERYONE, IS TRYING TO KILL ME.*\n\nJiaojiao was tired of it. She prided herself on her composure, but enough was enough. She had used an outhouse for gods sake. She'd touched a poo shovel with her bare hands. She'd eaten worm food. She'd even kowtowed today! What the hell was that?? She didn't know, but it wasn't living.\n\n*Besides, even if I do what you say, what's in it for me?* Jiaojiao shook her head. *Don't even try to con me with \"you get to live, mortal\" or some shit.*\n\nGuang Qiu vibrated, then fell silent.\n\n*I don't get anything out of listening to you, but more of this. And let me be real with you, it's not enough.*\n\n*Then what do you want?*\n\nBingo. *Well, is it possible for me to be sent back to my own worl--*\n\n*Impossible!* The ball said immediately. *I don't have the power to do so.*\n\n*That's going to be a tough sell for me, man.* Jiaojiao scoffed. *You pulled my soul over, don't tell me you can't send me back. I told you not to bullshit me.*\n\n*You don't understand,* the ball explained irately. *The passage between worlds is usually closed. Even today was a very rare case when the celestial bodies aligned just so. It was enough for Bai Jing to slip through. When she didn't come, and the passage was moments from closing, we had to take measures to find a comparable soul to fill her place.*\n\n*Comparable?* Jiaojiao pointed at herself. *You're saying me and Bai Jing are comparable? In what way?*\n\nRealizing he might have said too much, Guang Qiu hunkered down. *None of your business, mortal.*\n\n*That's interesting,* Jiaojiao said. *That is to say there are souls of different calibers? What is the criteria? It can't be that an assassin and an... entertainer have much in common at all, yet you used the word comparable. Intriguing.*\n\n*Stop thinking so much!*\n\nJiaojiao began to think. What did she have in common with Bai Jing? Certainly, neither of them could be considered average people. They were both *intelligent, beautiful,* and influential young women, both famous in their own circles, both rich, both Chinese-- though Jiaojiao only qualified by half, being a mix-breed with a Russian father. They were both skilled in their fields, though Guang Qiu would probably sneer to compare the art of blending foundation, to the art of the garrote.\n\nWas that where the similarities ended? Not really. \n\nFor one, they both had an ancient ancestry, though the earthly Bai Family (again, not to be confused with the Bai Family of Lan country) bore a mystical background as ancient practitioners of medicine. The MEI conglomerate's origins were far more mundane. They were businessmen, or merchants to use the more archaic term, a social class that was at the very bottom in ancient China, often met with censure and derision. And this attitude had not changed until the last two centuries or so. \n\nThen what were the differences? Not as much as the similarities anyway. Bai Jing had suffered from a childhood of abuse while Jiaojiao had been raised in the lap of luxury. This was the biggest difference between them, Jiaojiao thought. Bai Jing was used to suffering, and Jiaojiao, well. She was used to going with the path of least resistance. If there was an easier way, then that was the way she was going. Why suffer needlessly, after all?\n\nIf Jiaojiao had to put it crudely, they were both one in a million in terms of their life experiences.\n\nIn other words, people like them didn't just die everyday.\n\n*How did I die, Guang Qiu?* Jiaojiao asked.\n\n*...I believe it's called carbon monoxide poisoning, in your world.*\n\n*Of all the dumb...* Jiaojiao trailed off didn't speak for a long, long time. *Did anyone else die in the same incident that I did?*\n\n*Why does this matt--*\n\n*Just tell me!*\n\nGuang Qiu drew back at her vehemence *What!? How should I know? I grabbed the first soul I saw that could be used, I didn't stop to look around!*\n\nJiaojiao kept a hand at her neck, hand habitually grasping for something that wasn't there. She frowned, deep in thought. Where did that leave her? If Devika was dead, then why did she get to live? What made her so worthy? Was the world really this unfair?\n\n*Who's Devika?* Guang Qiu asked.\n\nJiaojiao glared. *I thought you couldn't hear my thoughts.*\n\n*You were thinking too loudly,* Guang Qiu said disdainfully. *Don't presume to think I would eavesdrop. Why would I stoop so low just to have a peek at a mere mortal's thoughts?*\n\n*She's my roommate,* Jiaojiao explained shortly. *If what you said is right, then she's probably dead too.*\n\nCarbon monoxide was colorless, tasteless, and the only symptoms that would generally manifest were dizziness, headaches and an upset stomach. No wonder she hadn't seen it coming. She'd merely blown it off as a flu. \n\n*Mortals. So fragile,* Guang Qiu said in liu of sympathy. *Don't take it so hard, she would have been dead in a mere fifty to sixty years anyway.*\n\n*As if fifty years is a trivial sampling of time!*\n\n*It is for me,* Guang Qiu said loftily.\n\nJiaojiao shook her head. She was asking too much if she thought this dumb ball could be understanding.\n\n*I have something I want, but I don't know if you can give it to me,* Jiaojiao said finally.\n\n*What?* The ball vibrated in impatience.\n\n*If you can bring me back to life, then you can bring others back to life too, correct?*\n\n*Absolutely not!* The ball cried, it's shape fuzzy and spiked with agitation. *You think this is a game? I won't do it, you can just give up that fanciful dream this instant!*\n\n*What's the matter?* Jiaojiao crossed her arms. *You resurrected me just fine. What's stopping you from doing it again for someone else?*\n\n*I wouldn't have bothered to do so if I were not compelled by extenuating circumstances! You think the cycle of reincarnation can just to flouted at a mortal's whim?*\n\n*Then I guess we have nothing to talk about,* Jiaojiao said. Her eyes were dark as she left the irate Guang Qiu to hobble into the darkened courtyard.","lastmodified":"2022-04-08T11:06:54.271654654Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/Chapter07-The-Stuttering-Concubine":{"title":"Chapter 07-The Stuttering Concubine","content":"A girl and a glowing ball stood over the prone form of an old woman in a deserted courtyard. The two stared down at the bound figure in silence, neither willing to be the first to speak after their apparent fall-out.\n\n*What do you intend to do with her?* The glowing ball asked finally. \n\n*What can be done?* Jiaojiao answered in a clipped manner. *I'm not going to kill her, don't ask me to do it again.*\n\n*We can't just leave her here,* the ball protested. *She's going to wake up eventually. What will you do then? What if she attacks you? Then what? With your current body you won't last two slaps from her. Even though this old thing is the bottom of the barrel in terms of strength, you are more feeble than a chicken.*\n\n*Don't put the faults of the body on me. It was in this state when I got here.*\n\n*And your original body was any better?* The ball sneered. \n\n*It could at least walk ten steps without getting dizzy.*\n\n*We seem to have gone off-topic,* the ball said. *What will you do when she wakes up?*\n\n*Well, if you want to see that damned bracelet again, I'm going to have to ask her what she's done with it.*\n\nThe ball fell silent, strangled.\n\n*If I'd gone ahead and killed her like you wanted where would I even know to look? Truly stupid.*\n\n*Mortal! You will show me the respect I'm due!*\n\nJiaojiao shook her head, then limped into the store room again, nearly tripping over a broken hoe. A bygone tool for a bygone time when the courtyard still had a viable garden she supposed. Further rummaging revealed more moldy twine and some rags that might have once been linens. Jiaojiao held them at arms length, dropping them in a pile next to Cen Wei. \n\nJiaojiao located a pair of rusty scissors in Cen Wei's quarters and snipped the piles of cloth into lengths that could be used to further bind the old woman. She made a game of cocooning the unconscious Cen Wei in swathes of smelly rags, grunting as she rolled the woman this way and that, taking petty revenge for all the times she'd felt belittled as she was manhandled by the old woman in the past day.\n\n*I think that's enough* the ball interrupted. *She is but a martial apprentice. This should be more than enough to hold her.*\n\nJiaojiao nodded, wiped the sweat from her brow with her sleeve, then dusted off her hands. She grabbed the bucket full of dirty dish water with difficulty and lugged it to the prone Cen Wei, dragging a trembling leg behind her. All the activity had set it afire with pain, but Jiaojiao grit her teeth and bore it. With more precarious maneuvering, she took a bowl and used it to splash dirty water onto the old woman's face.\n\nThe woman groaned, but did not wake. Another splash of water yielded similar results.\n\n*I think I might have hit her too hard.*\n\n*Well done,* the ball said sarcastically. *If you've killed her after all then what? After all that talk of not killing, you might have done the old woman in anyway. Splendid!*\n\nJiaojiao frowned and lifted one of the old woman's eyelids. Her pupils were blown out, and slightly uneven in size. She let the eyelid snap shut, and pushed down a very very slight pang of guilt.\n\n*Well, I'm no expert, but she seems concussed. I think she'll be fine. From what I understand, it's rare for you cultivators to die of something so small. Didn't people in the book bounce back from much worse?*\n\n*You're not wrong,* the ball said after a long moment. *I did a small scan. She will most likely be awake by noon tomorrow.*\n\nWhat was this scanning business? Jiaojiao wondered to herself. \n\n\"Ex-excuse me.\"\n\nJiaojiao turned to see a face peering at her and the fallen Cen Wei from the hole in the courtyard wall. The same face she'd spotted earlier in the day.\n\n\"She fell,\" Jiaojiao said.\n\nThe face didn't seem too know how to respond to this. \"Th-then, you-- I--\"\n\n*Excellent excuse,* the ball said. *I think she believes you.*\n\n\"What do you want?\" Jiaojiao asked.\n\n\"I-I was just...\" the face sputtered. \"I-- I know she's not a g-good woman. I saw y-you hit her, b-but don't w-worry, I w-won't tell anyone.\"\n\nJiaojiao limped closer to the wall. The face seemed taken aback, and almost seemed ready to make a run for it at her approach. \n\nIt was a beautiful face, delicate and smooth, with sparkling eyes, thought they were currently darting back and forth nervously. The young woman had red lips and even teeth. She was a great beauty, and Jiaojiao could not help staring, trying to rank the young woman on her personal list of outstanding faces. It was even more impressive given that plastic surgery was non-existent in this world.\n\n\"Top twenty for sure.\"\n\n\"W-what?\" The woman blinked at her. \n\n\"It's nothing.\"\n\n*Who is she?* Jiaojiao asked Guang Qiu.\n\n*...I don't know,* the ball responded after a long moment. *I don't think she is mentioned in the book at all.*\n\n\"Wh-what are y-you going to d-do now?\" the woman asked, anxiously holding an embroidered sleeve to her mouth. \"That old s-servant has been b-bought off by Head W-wife Zh-zhang. Sh-she won't b-be h-happy...\"\n\n*You need to stop speaking with her,* the ball cautioned. *You aren't supposed to meet this person at all.*\n\nWell, now she *had* to speak to this woman!\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\n\"I-I'm,\" the woman jolted back as if shocked. \"I'm a con-concubine of Family Head B-bai. I m-moved in-into this c-c-courtyard l-last month.\"\n\nWhat a way to refer to your own husband. Jiaojiao had almost forgotten that this was an era with very unbalanced gender roles. A man could own as many women as he could afford while a woman... heh. Plumbing didn't exist, but the patriarchy was alive and well!\n\n\"Bai Qinghan?\" Jiaojiao fished the name from the text in her head.\n\nThe woman's eyes widened. \"Y-you can't sp-speak your f-father's n-name like that! It's im-improper!\"\n\nJiaojiao almost rolled her eyes, but didn't want to further scandalize the stuttering beauty. What if she bit herself?\n\n\"Why did you call out to me?\" Jiaojiao asked instead.\n\n\"I was w-worried about y-you.\"\n\nJiaojiao wasn't sure she believed her. If she'd moved into the courtyard a month ago, then she must have seen her fair share of Bai Xingyue's suffering. \"Why now?\"\n\n\"You- you've k-kicked a h-hornet's nest now, b-by acting against the old w-woman. Head Wi-wife Zhang won't l-let this go. Y-you are in d-danger.\"\n\nHead Wife Zhang. What was she, some kind of end boss? \"I was always in danger.\"\n\n\"Y-you've never f-fought b-back before today. It's d-different. Y-you're,\" the woman gave her a meaningful gaze, \"you're d-different.\"\n\n\"I didn't have a choice. She was poisoning me and refused to get a doctor to look at my leg.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" the woman ducked her head. \"Th-that's awful of h-her. I a-always thought sh-she was a t-terrible person. Th-the way she tre-treated you.\"\n\n*Did you hear me!?* Guang Qiu roared. *Stop talking! Don't interact with irrelevant people!*\n\n\"I actually do need help,\" Jiaojiao said. \"Can you find a way to get a doctor to me?\"\n\n\"I--\" the woman looked down. \"I-I'm s-ss-sorry, but I c-can't do that.\"\n\nTsk.\n\n\"B-but, I have a way to g-get you o-out of the e-estate.\"\n\nJiaojiao smiled. \n\n\"B-but I d-don't think y-you should do it,\" the woman's eyes blinked rapidly. \"It's not a s-safe place out there for a y-young lady.\"\n\nJiaojiao gestured at her face. \"If you're worried about people taking advantage of me, as you can see...\"\n\nThe woman blushed charmingly, blood red and beguiling. \"I-I'm--you--\" she looked anywhere but at Jiaojiao's face. \"Being b-beauti-f-f-ful isn't e-every-thing.\"\n\nJiaojiao dissected her words, wondering why the woman was blushing for a dumbfounded moment. Was it because Jiaojiao spoke of being assaulted? Because she was embarrassed on Jiaojiao's behalf for her ugliness? And how dare she say that? Beauty was everything!\n\nJiaojiao built a career from beauty, and felt a bone-deep irritation at hearing this statement. Maybe the woman could feel how hypocritical she was being, speaking to her with that face?\n\nWell, whatever, it wasn't really any of her business. This was after all, *not her face.*\n\n\"Cen Wei pawned something really important of mine today,\" Jiaojiao said after an awkward silence. \"Do you have any idea where she might have taken it?\"\n\n\"Oh, well, \" the woman played with a strand of her hair, brow furrowed delicately. \"I'm not sure, but I think my first guess would be to try Yixin street. It has the most pawn shops. If you ask one by one, you are bound to find it sooner or later?\"\n\n*Good job, mortal! The end is in sight!* Guang Qiu cried, pulling an abrupt one-eighty.\n\n*Yeah? What happened to \"don't talk to irrelevant people\" huh?*\n\nGuang Qiu didn't dignify her with an answer. \n\n\"How long is this street? How many pawn shops are we talking?\"\n\n\"Well, it can't be more than fifty shops, surely?\"\n\n\"*Fifty shops?*\"  Jiaojiao echoed incredulously. \"Is the city nothing but pawn shops?\"\n\nThe woman laughed, a delightful clarity to her voice. \"Have you never been into the city? There's--\" then her eyes darted to the mark on her face and her laughter died. \"I'm s-sorry, I sh-shouldn't laugh. The c-city is very l-large. Yi-yixin street is nothing b-but a t-tiny c-corner of it.\"\n\n\"Great, splendid,\" Jiaojiao grumbled. \"I suppose I'm expected to get there on foot?\"\n\n*Mortal, you cannot balk now. The artifact is of the utmost importance.*\n\n\"You c-could always hire a r-rickshaw,\" the woman said with a sympathetic glance at her leg. \"You c-can p-probably sneak away f-for a d-day with no-no one noticing. Unless of c-course the th-third miss comes l-looking for you.\"\n\nJiaojiao shook her head. A little girl with a misplaced crush was the least of her concerns right now. \n\n\"How will you get me out?\"\n\n\"Come to my courtyard tomorrow morning. This section of the estate is not in good repair... anyway, you will see.\"\n\nAfter that, the face in the wall disappeared from sight. The sun was setting, throwing gloomy shadows over the lonely courtyard. The dried leaves rustled in the corners of the walls when a stray wind teased them, sending a rasping whispers echoing along the empty space. Cold blew in with the dusk, Jiaojiao drew her shoulders up to her ears, an insistent ache troubled her bad leg with the drop in temperature.\n\nShe took a disinterested glance at the prone form, stewing in dirty dish water in the middle of the courtyard. Sympathy was hard worn when she remembered how her own body had spent the last night in sopping wet clothes. Those two \"meals\" that old woman had fed her didn't help her case either.\n\n\"Good night, old woman,\" Jiaojiao said, draping her moldy blanket over Cen Wei before entering the servant's quarters and throwing the door shut behind her.\n\n*You're going to just leave her out there?*\n\n\"I can't move her with this leg, you want to give it a try? Besides, didn't you want her dead? She's lucky I gave her a covering at all,\" Jiaojiao said testily. As the dark encroached, Jiaojiao fumbled for an old pottery lantern, sporting hairline cracks. It was nothing more that a dish with congealed animal fat, a half-burnt cloth wick sticking out the side. \n\n\"How do I light this?\" Jiaojiao asked Guang Qiu.\n\n*Stupid mortal, use the huo zhe zi!*\n\nAfter some condescending instructions, Jiaojiao managed to use the antiquated old tube to produce a flame and touch it to the lamp wick. Jiaojiao squinted in the flickering light, displeased at the inadequate light levels and the smell of rancid fat sizzling away. She sorely missed modern lamps.\n\n\"How do people live like this?\"\n\n*Stop whining, it's just a little dark.*\n\n\"A little dark?\" Jiaojiao shook her head, rummaging in Cen Wei's things for a needle and thread. \"People would go blind working in these conditions. The eye strain is unbelievable.\"\n\n*Are you planning on staying here for the night?*\n\n\"It's not like the original occupant is using it. Besides, it's far cleaner than that mess in the other residence-- don't even start, I know what you're about to say, but why do I have to live in that miserable shack? Even Bai Jing didn't sleep there.\"\n\n*Heh, you have the gall to speak of Bai Jing?* Guang Qiu hovered over Jiaojiao, it's smoky form gloomy like a thundercloud. *Bai Jing would have bound the bracelet right now and contracted the White Tiger guardian. She would have entered the space and spent the night there!*\n\n\"*Not Bai Jing*,\" Jiaojiao sang.\n\n*If you had done something instead of letting f the bracelet slip through your fingers--*\n\nJiaojiao turned a deaf ear, busy inspecting the primitive sewing kit laid out before her. It came nestled in a plain wooden box, but all the necessary tools were there, including a set of metal needles and some plain off-white cotton thread. They weren't comparable to modern tools, but they would have to do.\n\n*--never in all my years have I seen such incompetence! I... what are you doing now?*\n\n\"Huh? Isn't it obvious?\" Jiaojiao smirked, expertly threading a needle. \"I'm doing what I do best.\"","lastmodified":"2022-04-08T11:06:54.271654654Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/NaNoWriMo-April-2022":{"title":"üå± NaNoWriMo-April 2022","content":"---\n\nI've had this idea for a book series bouncing around for quite some time and [NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org/what-is-camp-nanowrimo) was just the excuse that I needed to jumpstart the whole endeavor.
