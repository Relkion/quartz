From the scuffed corners of the _hongmu_ armoire, to the cracked surface of the low tea table with mother of pearl inlay, every detail screamed of bygone grandeur. The mustiness in the air hinted at age and neglect.\n\nJIaojiao didn't react for a good ten seconds, staring here and there at the ratty paper windows, thrice mended and patched with ragged bits of cloth, at the exposed brown bricks beyond the cracked lime plaster, at the moth eaten covers over her too-small lap. She held up her bony hands, chapped, with yellowed uneven nails.\n\n\"Oh no,\" Jiaojiao spoke aloud. \"I'm having a stroke.\"\n\nBecause, that could be the only explanation for this... this farce of a hallucination, right? She had only just been arguing with... who was it? Right, Superb_Ninja2394, defending her controversial decision to pair Galaxy Sunrise nail polish with hot pink stripes and gold decals. Why else would she be seeing this scene out of a half-baked period drama. It was a stroke.\n\nA stroke. It had to be.\n\nBecause... what would be the alternative?\n\nWith mounting horror, Jiaojiao used her not-her-hands to touch her not-her-face. It was small, thin, and _unmoisturized_. _Who was this person?_\n\nShe didn't get to dwell on it further before the door to the bedroom burst open with a crack of distressed wood.\n\n\"Bai Xingyue, you slut!\" cried a sweet young voice.\n\nFramed in the doorway, with her leg still raised in a high-kick, was a young girl in a pink _hanfu_, perhaps twelve to fifteen years old. Pearled hairpins in the shapes of flowers and birds swayed with her movements. Her tender face was scrunched in a scowl that was more cute in the way of angry kittens and growling puppies, than intimidating.\n\nBai Xingyue? Is she talking about _not-me_?\n\nThe girl didn't waste a second rushing into the room, hand raised in a maneuver Jiaojiao recognized well as the classic posture for a slap, so well exemplified in Chinese harem dramas. She shifted out of the way, though her body responded much more sluggishly than she was used to.\n\nThe angry girl's pink embroidered sleeves billowed as her fist landed on the traditional _kang_ bed. Rather than bouncing off the woven bottom as Jiaojiao expected, that tiny palm blasted through in an explosion of bamboo shards.\n\n\"You dare dodge?!\" The girl screeched, then pouted at the _audacity_.\n\nJiaojiao was too baffled to speak. What then? So should she stay still and get her head smashed in? The hell was with this strength? Was this ninety pound loli She-ra incarnate?\n\n\"I-- I'm sorry?\" Jiaojiao finally rasped out, noting that the voice was not her voice, but what else was new? The moment the words were out of her-- _not-her mouth_, there was a brief buzz in Jiaojiao's mind. Jiaojiao frowned, raising a hand to her head. More signs she was having a stroke, surely.\n\n\"You think apologizing is enough?\" the girl sneered, hand raised for another slap. \"You slut. Why didn't you just drown in that pond?¬†You think such lowly tactics would attract the crown prince? Naive!\"\n\n*What was this about a crown prince? So this is a historical drama? What dynasty? Is this a drama with wuxia elements?* Jiaojiao thought wildly to herself. How else to explain this girls strength? Her mind swiftly ran the gamut of routine hypotheticals. *Is this a movie set? Am I getting punked? Where are the cameras? Where is the crew? Is this a dream? Why am I even thinking about this? I could be dying right as we speak, brain cells withering from lack of oxygen! Are the paramedics even on the way?* Knowing her usual audience they wouldn't care to call for help even if it became obvious rigor was setting in.\n\n_Doomed. I'm doomed._\n\nThe pink loli didn't take kindly to being ignored. Jiaojiao felt a distinct danger to her hallucinatory life as that white hand descended for another slap. She hastily rolled away though she felt serious doubts about her current situation. Surely none of this mattered even if her head did became roadkill? That is-- If she truly was having a stroke. The bed groaned as another hole appeared by the first.\n\n\"The crown prince wouldn't even deign to let you lick his shoes! You're a toad lusting for swan meat!\" The girl sneered. \"You should just kill yourself and save me the trouble of dirtying my hands!\"\n\n\"The crown prince?\" Jiaojiao parroted, curled up in the corner of the bed, bracketed by wall and headboard and and covered in bamboo slivers.\n\n\"You still have the face to speak of the crown prince!?\"\n\nThird slap incoming, Jiaojiao had run out of rolling space. She hastily raised both hands in a gesture of surrender. \"Wait!\"\n\nThe girl paused and regarded Jiaojiao in disgust. Behind her, two servants in plain blue robes had entered at some point and were staring at Jiaojiao in shaudenfraude.\n\n\"I have no interest in the crown prince,\" Jiaojiao said. It was the truth, who was this crown prince even?\n\n\"Hah! As if I would believe your lies!\"\n\n\"Hold on!\" Jiaojiao called, interrupting that hand descending like a guillotine. \"I-- I've lost my memories!\"\n\n\"Hah?\" The girl glared, but the hand remained suspended.\n\n\"I... don't even know who you are?\" Jiaojiao supplied.\n\nThe girl scrutinized Jiaojiao from head to toe, as if there would be physical signs to elude to the veracity of that statement. She leaned forward, staring into Jiaojiao's face.\n\n\"Don't believe her, young miss,\" one of the servants interrupted.\n\n\"She's just lying to escape punishment,\" the other servant agreed.\n\nJiaojiao met the girl's gaze straight on. \"I really truly have lost my memories. I don't even know my own name.\"\n\n\"What a liar,\" the first servant laughed. \"Just slap her to death.\"\n\n\"Slap her to death!\"\n\n_What is wrong with these people?_\n\n\"Hmph,\" the girl finally smiled. \"So what if you don't remember? Now hold still so I can rid the world of an eyesore.\"\n\n\"You're seriously trying to kill her-- me?\" Jiaojiao asked with doubt.\n\n\"You finally understand,\" the girl smiled. Objectively, it was a nice smile on a pretty face, but it made the hairs stand up on the back of Jiaojiao's neck.\n\n\"Can we talk about this?\" Jiaojiao scrunched herself as far as she could go into the corner.\n\n\"What is there to talk about? You should have died back there in that pond. I'm just finishing the job.\"\n\nJiaojiao could only watch as that hand resumed its merciless descent, a harsh buzz began in her mind as the palm neared her unprotected face. The buzz reached an annoying crescendo then cut off with a wrathful pop.\n\nA bright box bloomed into view, floating in Jiaojiao's vision like a phantom.\n\nSimultaneously, the girl's descending slap suddenly veered off to the right and hit the wall with a crackle of broken plaster.\n\nThough her face had narrowly escaped getting pancaked by mere millimeters, Jiaojiao could only stare at the floating box in befuddlement. It was a translucent screen with a block of white text scrolling past and looked like something out of a VR simulation.\n\nThe girl hissed and shook out her blushing palm, smarting from the impact to the brick wall. \"You bitch, how dare you dodge!?\"\n\nThe servants darted forward, cooing in distress over their mistress's hand.\n\n\"You wretch! How could you hurt the miss's hand like this!\"\n\nJiaojiao was too distracted to answer, eyes riveted on the contents of that floating box that no one else seemed to see.\n\n*Bai Jing woke in a dirty old bedroom...**\n\n_Bai Jing smiled enchantingly as she caught Bai Xingwu's hand in an iron fist..._\n\n_Bai Jing kicked the girl away with her slim leg..._\n\n_Bai Jing slapped the impudent servant..._\n\n_Bai Jing..._\n\n\"Who the fuck is Bai Jing?\" Jiaojiao said.\n\nThe girl and the two servants stared agog at her outburst.\n\n\"Is there a Bai Jing in the family?\"\n\n\"I don't think so.\"\n\n\"What is she staring at?\"\n\n\"Maybe she's finally gone crazy.\"\n\n\"Heh! If I were her, I would've have gone crazy when I first heard I was a martial cripple.\"\n\n\"I would have just hung myself and ended it all.\"\n\n\"How could the crown prince have such a hideous toad for a fianc√©?\"\n\nThe servants tittered.\n\n\"Silence!\" The girl snapped, still rubbing her sore hand. \"Don't speak of the crown prince with your lowly mouths!\"\n\nThe servants bowed their heads. Though chastised, the corners of their lips turned up as they snuck glances at Jiaojiao and the girl in pink, no doubt anticipating the ensuing carnage.\n\nWhat bunch of manipulative she-devils.\n\nJiaojiao finally turned her gaze back to the bristling girl in pink, having finished digesting the contents of the floating box-- though not all of it made sense, she was beginning to get a hint of what was going on.\n\n\"Is your name Bai Xingwu?\"\n\nThe girl curled her lip up in ridicule. \"I thought you lost your memories?\"\n\n\"So it is,\" Jiaojiao pointed to the ghostly text box. \"None of you see that?\"\n\n\"See what? Don't think pretending to be crazy will get you out of anything!\"\n\n\"What do you want me to do?\" Jiaojiao asked, exasperated. \"Should I just lie down and let you kill me?\"\n\n\"It would be your honor to be killed by me!\"\n\nJiaojiao refrained from rolling her eyes. \"What can I do so that you won't kill me?\"\n\nBai Xingwu smiled, eyes crinkling in mirthful crescents. \"Kowtow. Kowtow until I tell you to stop.\"\n\n*And what if you never tell me to stop?* Jiaojiao rebutted internally. \"Fine,\" she said instead with a diplomatic smile and crawled off of the _kang_, avoiding the wreckage of the girl's punches. She paused as her right leg gave a twinge in pain.\n\n\"What are you waiting for?\" Bai Xingwu prodded, her smile mean and knowing.\n\nJiaojiao shuffled awkwardly to the dusty floor, then knelt, right knee now screaming in protest. There was definitely something up with that leg but she didn't currently have the time to address it. She took a distracted moment to admire Bai Xingwu's pearl-studded shoes, then lowered her head in the first kowtow, grimacing as the dirty floor neared her face. After a minute pause, her forehead touched the ground with an audible tap.\n\nThe harsh buzzing began anew. The girl gave her a pointed glare when Jiaojiao paused in thought.\n\n_It's all a stroke anyway! Why am I worrying?_\n\nOnly Jiaojiao knew herself fairly well, and she wasn't imaginative enough to dream this shit up by far.\n\nShe was feeling pain in a hallucination-- maybe not a hallucination. Every sight, smell, and feeling was indicating that she might _possibly, not really, actually_ be having a stroke.\n\nJiaojiao grit her teeth and began her second kowtow. Ignoring the buzzing in her head. A new box of text popped up next to the first, bobbing insistently. She gave it a cursory glance, then covertly rolled her eyes.\n\n_Bai Jing laughed as the servant wailed in pain..._\n\n_Bai Jing broke Bai Xingwu's hand with a snap of her wrist..._\n\n_\"How dare you call this great aunt a slut? Are you speaking of yourself?\"_\n\nOn her fifth kowtow, sweat began to head on her brow. Jiaojiao didn't enjoy pain and in fact usually went out of her way to avoid it-- like a normal person. This experience was swiftly becoming the most painful one she'd ever had the misfortune of encountering.\n\nJiaojiao touched her head to the dusty floor for the six time, the ground now damp with her sweat.\n\n\"Cry for me,\" Bai Xingwu suggested cooly. \"Ask for my forgiveness.\"\n\nWith a sniff, Jiaojiao began to wail and covered her face with her dusty hands, pressing down on her eyelids until her tear glands welled up with physiological tears. Blinking rapidly, she choked on her sobs as she coyly looked down.\n\n\"Hah! You're so ugly,\" the girl said, \"kowtow to me nine times and I'll let you go for today!\"\n\nThe ground beneath her face was now dotted with tears as well as saliva and sweat. Jiaojiao wailed theatrically, face coated in dust and grime.\n\n\"Look how ugly she is.\"\n\n\"Hideous.\"\n\n\"So disgusting.\"\n\nJiaojiao sobbed noisily, slurping a disgusting mixture of snot and tears with every inhale and exhale. The buzzing had now grown to deafening levels and Jiaojiao could hardly hear the servants deprecating commentary. Jiaojiao's entire focus had narrowed to the pain in her leg, and she had begun shaking from maintaining her posture. Only a certain premonition was preventing her from breaking this farce of a scene.\n\nThankfully, Bai Xingwu soon grew bored of the spectacle and takes before swinging her head, hairpins flashing with lustrous light.\n\n\"Let this be a lesson to you, slut! Don't you dare covet the crown prince! He is the heavens and you are less than dirt,\" the girl spat, then left with a swish of her sleeves, leaving behind only the scent of jasmine. Her two servants shot Jiaojiao one last ridiculing glance, then scurried after their mistress, kicking the ruins of the door aside on their way out.\n\nJiaojiao's cries cut off with an abruptness that struck of artificiality. She wiped her face with a tattered sleeve and regarded her departing audience with a lackluster expression.\n\nWhen the trio disappeared from view, so too did the buzzing cease.\n\nThe air grew heavy and solemn as Jiaojiao scanned her surroundings, hobbling back to the _kang_, now sporting two mango sized holes.\n\n\"All right, there's no one here,\" Jiaojiao said to the air. \"Come out.\"","lastmodified":"2022-04-15T11:37:36.433801Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/Chapter02-The-Missing-Heroine":{"title":"Chapter 02-The Missing Heroine","content":"There was a heavy silence the moment Jiaojiao spoke to the empty room. Oppressive and somehow, sullen.\n\n*How did you know?* A voice asked sourly in her head. It was an ambiguous voice with a distinct lack of defining characteristics, neither male nor female and neither young or old.\n\n\"Did you think you were being subtle with the buzzing and humming?\" Jiaojiao scoffed, scanning the room for the disembodied voice. \"It was like having a silenced phone go off directly by my ear. Where are you anyway?\"\n\nA dim cloud of light, about the size of two fists popped into existence directly in front of Jiaojiao. She eyed it curiously. This was the the source of infernal buzzing?\n\n\"Who are you? What the hell is going on?\"\n\n*Who I am is none of your concern.*\n\n\"I'd say that's a sizzling hot take given that you're a hundred percent responsible for--\" she gestured at her current body.\n\nThe ball of light gave a disdainful buzz. *You're not required to know.*\n\n*Wow.* \"You got a name?\"\n\nThere came a prickling feeling from the cloud of light that Jiaojiao translated as irritation. *That's not important. What is important is that you were a disgrace just now. Why did you kowtow?*\n\n\"And what was the alternative? Let her squash me like a rice cake?\"\n\n*You could have fought back,* the ball of light grumbled. *You should-- what are you doing?!*\n\nJiaojiao tsked as her hand closed around nothing, the ball of light darting away from her grasping fingers. \n\n*How ill-mannered!* The ball scolded. *Keep your hands to yourself!*\n\n\"I'd say you've gone way beyond the boundaries of rudeness when you whisked my-- what? Soul? Into this place.\"\n\n*Can you be compared to me, puny mortal?*\n\n\"Puny mortal? Oh, it's like that is it?\" Jiaojiao smiled thinly. \"What does that make you, a god?\"\n\n*I may as well be a god!*\n\n\"Well, forgive me my impudence, oh *god*.\"\n\nA grudging hum. *You are forgiven, mortal. I myself made an error in judgement. I should not have put much expectation in your decorum in the first place given your... occupation.*\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n*You are after all--* a delicate pause *--an entertainer.*\n\n\"Entertain-- what?\"\n\n*And entertainers are not known for their refined behavior.*\n\nJiaojiao eyed the ball of light in thought. It seemed, the thing, god or whatever, had a superficial understanding of her, and an even worse understanding of the world she came from. And his sensibilities were downright ancient.\n\n\"What makes you think I'm an entertainer?\" she asked.\n\n*What else would you call what you do? You display yourself for the amusement of others. Is this not the definition of an entertainer? A lowly occupation with no meaningful worth to society?*\n\n\"Christ, who are you, my mother?\"\n\n*But we seem to have ventured onto a tangental thread of conversation. We were discussing--what are you doing now?!*\n\nJiaojiao ignored the ball and lifted the hem of her frayed robes and rolled up her pants to look at that damned right leg that had been troubling her. A knotted expanse of scar tissue and a crooked calf met her horrified gaze. She silently dropped the hem of her robe. *Not my body, not my problem.*\n\n*See this is exactly what I meant! No lady-like bearing at all! Baring your flesh for all the world to see!*\n\n\"The world isn't in here. Just you,\" Jiaojiao said. \"And besides, shouldn't it be you who is in the wrong for being in a young girl's boudoir?\"\n\n*As I was saying,* the ball's light pulsed with rage, *you have a lot to answer for, you disgraceful harlot.*\n\n\"No, don't hold back on my account. Tell me what you really think.\"\n\n*You bowed and scraped like a beggar. Have you seen yourself?*\n\n\"No actually,\" Jiaojiao answered. \"I can say with all honesty I have never seen myself.\"\n\n*Well, you are an absolute shame to behold! I am embarrassed on your behalf! Did you really have to kowtow?* the ball of light continued. *If you could have just--*\n\n\"Fought back?\" she pointed at her leg. \"You've seen the leg. This body is basically crippled.\"\n\n*Bai Jing did it, and she had the same leg. She fought Bai Xingwu and won. That's how it's supposed to go. Bai Xingwu and her two servants retreat in terror after losing to Bai Jing in a three on one fight.* The ball of light paused, and a heavy sense of oppression emanated from it. *At least, that's how it's supposed to go.*\n\nJiaojiao smiled a smile that wasn't a smile. \"Say, are you confused about something? What do those three have to do with me? Why should any of this have anything to do with me? You and I both know that I'm not this Bai Jing person.\"\n\nA heavy pause. The light flickered like a staticky TV.\n\n*Interesting.* The it finally said. *Most people would hesitate before admitting they weren't the person meant to be here. After all, you just died and it can be surmised that I'm the sole reason you still live and breathe...**\n\n\"Yes, yes, yes, you are very mighty, very powerful, I am very impress,\" Jiaojiao waved a hand. \"That doesn't change the fact that I am not Bai Jing and you can't expect me to behave like her.\"\n\n*You don't have a choice. You have already died. The person you were no longer exists. If you cannot be Bai Jing then there is no use for you at all.*\n\nJiaojiao wrinkled her nose then took a sniff of her shoulder, having been nagged by the faint smell of mildew ever since waking. She got a whiff of stagnant water and algae. A tell-tale patch of green on her sleeve drew her attention. Well, that angry little girl had said something about a near drowning. A completed drowning? After all, *she* was here.\n\n*It should be obvious that I hold your very life and death in my hands...*\n\nJiaojiao sidestepped the ball and hobbled over to the battered armoire taking a hold of the ornated bronze handles, green with oxidation. When a firm tug left the doors unbudging, she leveraged all eighty-five pounds of her new body to wrench it open. Her arms ached with the strain and the nerves in her bum leg screamed in protest. The doors stuck on each other, swollen with age and moisture. A glance overhead revealed a patch of missing roof tiles, repaired haphazardly with a few handfuls of thatch and straw twine.\n\nInside the armoire was a collection of worn and aged clothing, moth-eaten silk and frayed cotton in various washed out colors. Jiaojiao paused. Did she really have to don these... these *rags*?\n\n*If you want to continue living, you will do well to follow my instructions... are you listening to me?*\n\n\"Yes, I am very invested in this conversation. Do continue.\"\n\n*You are dead.*\n\n\"Uh huh.\"\n\n*... shouldn't you be more upset?*\n\n \"What?\" Jiaojiao rifled through the meager selection of *hanfu*. \"Should I be weeping and wailing? Groveling at your feet for absolution?\"\n\n*It would be the expected reaction.*\n\n\"I'm already dead, what's to be done?'\" Jiaojiao said. \"I won't waste my time begging you for something you won't change. After all, if you were truly kind, you would have revived me in my own body instead of casting me as this Bai Jing person.\"\n\nA hum of grudging agreement came from the ball. *I brought you here for a purpose.*\n\nJIaojiao chose one of the least ratty robes and pulled it from the armoire. \"Avert your virgin eyes, o' god, for this filthy mortal entertainer is about to disrobe.\"\n\nThe ball gave a disgusted snarl and zipped to hide behind the armoire door. *Have you heard a single word I've said? Must you do that now?*\n\n\"Dead mortal, alive on your grace, here for a mission. I'm all ears. And yes, I'm reeking of pond scum, and I simply cannot stand it a second longer.\"\n\n*...as I was saying, your only purpose here is to take the place of Bai Jing.*\n\n\"What happened to her anyway?\" Jiaojiao asked as she shucked the damp robe from her body. It was of noticeably finer make and she would have preferred wearing it to the beggars garment she was shortly about to don were it not foul with pond water.\n\nThe ball of light paused, as if loathe to disclose an iota more information than absolutely necessary. *She failed the appear at the correct time. We were forced to take drastic measures to ensure the continuity of this fateline.*\n\nJiaojiao's eyes flashed as she bowed her head to tie the belt on her clean robe. *Fate-line? Does that have something to do with that box of text I just saw?* \"So I have her to thank for this second life?\"\n\n*You have __me__ to thank for this second life.*\n\n\"Sure boss, whatever you say.\"\n\n*I'm glad you understand your position. Just do as you're told and all will be well.*\n\n\"What happens if I don't do as I'm told?\"\n\nThe ball of light floated in front of Jiaojiao. A palpable oppression prickled at her skin as the light burst in intensity, bright stripes strobed across its surface. *Then I'll get rid of you and find a more obedient replacement.* \n\nJiaojiao shivered, then smiled thinly. \"Got it.\"\n\nThe ball seemed satisfied with her response, withdrawing out of arms reach and the light dimmed to less blinding levels.\n\n\"So what do I have to do?\"\n\nThe light began to strobe again. *Hold still, this will only hurt a bit.*\n\nThe world exploded into light.\n\nJiaojiao eyes stung as the light hit her eyes, she lifted an arm to shield herself, but it didn't seem to make a difference. The it was like the light was piercing straight past her flesh and directly impacting her brain tissue. The beginnings of a migraine began to make itself known as dense blocks of text scrolled past her vision at an accelerated pace. Even as Jiaojiao thought that this was far too fast for anyone to read, the information seared itself into her mind as though it was being directly funneled into her synapses.\n\n*Bai Jing stood at the cliffside with her lover Fei Chen. The distant sunset gave a romantic backdrop to their rendevous.*\n\n*\"Fel Chen, it has been almost ten years since we made that promise.\"\n\n*\"I remember...\"*\n\n*\"We can leave everything behind now...\"*\n\n*Fei Chen embraced Bai Jing, smiling down at his beautiful fiance. Bai Jing smiled and turned her face upwards to receive his fiery kiss...*\n\n*Bai Jing gasped, the pulled back at a sudden sharp pain on her chest. Right over her heart pierced a dagger. A brilliant blood-red flower bloomed...*\n\n*\"Why?\" she asked the sinisterly smiling Fei Chen.*\n\n\"I've never loved you, Bai Jing? Who would love a coarse mercenary like you? My true love is your half-sister! I was only after the inheritance your mother left you!\" \n\n*Fei Chen snatched the embroidered pouch from Bai Jing's chilled fingers.*\n\n*\"Fei Chen, you better pray I don't live, or I'll make you sorry...\"*\n\n*Bai Jing plunged from the cliff...*\n\nJiaojiao could only stand, transfixed as more text scrolled past her vision. She screwed her eyes shut, but nothing could stop the information pouring into her mind. Dear lord this is torture.\n\n*Bai Jing awoke in an ancient bedroom...*\n\n*Bai Jing spoke to the reflection in the bronze mirror. \"Fate has given me a second chance, I won't let your sacrifice go to waste. I will avenge all your grievamces and punish all those who drove you to your death!\"\"*\n\n*Bai Jing kicked Bai Xingwu across the room...*\n\n*Bai Jing smiled...*\n\n*Bai Jing laughed...*\n\n*Bai Jing sneered...*\n\nJiaojiao felt like she was going crazy. On and on it went until finally the text slowed to a crawl before disappearing with a faint pop. She opened her eyes and gave the ball of light a dirty look.\n\n*Well?* The ball of light said impatiently, *Did you get all of it?*\n\nJiaojiao gave a mirthless chuckle. \"Oh I got it. There's just one little problem.\"\n\n*What is it?*\n\n\"Are you kidding? You made it sound like some grand mission but I can't do this,\" JIaojiao shook her head. \"Nope. I can't help you.\" \n\n*I don't follow.*\n\n\"You don't need a heroine! You need an editor! Nothing less will save us from this crappy webnovel!\"","lastmodified":"2022-04-15T11:37:36.43780101Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/Chapter03-The-Cold-Prince-Loves-Me-Dearly":{"title":"Chapter 03-The Cold Prince Loves Me Dearly","content":"\"The Cold Prince Loves me Dearly?\" Jiaojiao could barely get the words out through her upset. \"You brought me here for this?\"\n\n*I fail to see what the problem is.*\n\n\"Fail to see the problem-- of course you would. You're not he one being forced to play out over five hundred chapters of nonsense!\"\n\n*Actually, it's over five thousand, but I didn't want to overload your puny mortal brain with too much information at once.*\n\n*Lord, guanyin, yama, whoever, save me from this farce.* Jiaojiao slumped over the *kang.* A webnovel! Not only was this a webnovel, it was a badly written one too, with plot holes, repetitive plot lines and more tired tropes than she could care to name. Not only that, it was of the xianxia genre, heavily featuring a romance she found highly problematic. Not only that! There were *xian* and *gui* and whole bunch of other things she wasn't equipped to deal with. \n\nThere was cultivation. That explained that angry girl's inhuman strength, and apparently her display of prowess was only the tip of the iceberg.\n\n\"Piz-dets,\" Jiaojiao muttered.\n\n*What was that?*\n\n\"Say, you seem to have overlooked something very important, Guang Qiu.\"\n\n*Guang Qiu?* The ball of light vibrated in agitation. *You are addressing me?*\n\n\"You are a ball of light and you refuse to disclose your name to the likes of I, so yes, Guang Qiu.\"\n\n*The nerve! I am far more than some ball of light!*\n\n\"Anyway, Guang Qiu,\" Jiaojiao continued. \"You seemed to have forgotten that an *entertainer* and an assassin have very different skill sets.\"\n\nThat's right. Bai Jing, the missing heroine, was an assassin. Not only was she an assassin, she was the supposedly the best of her kind, feared in the underworld of her original world as the embodiment of death. Her victims numerous enough to \"circle the globe once.\" Jiaojiao was too lazy to inspect the math on that claim.\n\n Trained in the art of killing from the tender age of seven, she could kill you with a knife, she could kill you a spoon, hell, she could probably kill with both her hands *and legs* tied behind her back. And not only was she good at killing people, she was trained in both western and eastern medicine. \n\nShe could kill with a needle, and she could similarly save lives with one too. At least, if the contents of the webnovel were to be believed.  \n\nA merciless reaper with a heart of gold. Beautiful, treacherous, and cold. Cold at least, when it came to people other than her paramour, Fei Chen.\n\nThe same Fei Chen who apparently stabbed her in the heart and forced her off a cliff for some mystical inheritance.\n\nYikes.\n\nAnyway, the recently murdered Bai Jing, understandably wrathful, had somehow revived in the body of also recently murdered Bai Xingyue, the same drowned body that Jiaojiao was currently wearing. And here was where the road split.\n\nBai Jing the assassin kicked Bai Xingwu and her two servants into next year,  laughing at their attempts to bully her. Then, she forced them to kowtow, beating their foreheads bruised and bloodied before sending them scurrying back whence they came, cradling broken wrists and broken egos.\n\nJiaojiao the influencer showed as much spine as a sea anenome and debased herself like the filthy mortal entertainer she was. \n\n*No, matter,* the ball of light said smoothly, *with me here, all your inadequacies will be immaterial.*\n\nJiaojiao gave a ball a thousand-yard stare and shuffled toward the bedroom exit, squeezing past the door barely hanging on by one hinge.\n\n*Where are you going?*\n\n\"This mortal has some mortal things to do.\"\n\n*What things can possible be more important than the mission?*\n\n\"Bathroom!\"\n\n*Bathroom?*\n\n\"It's called a bladder you disembodied simpleton.\"\n\nShe left the sputtering Guang Qiu to get upset over her directness, hobbling past a dusty room, equally sad as the one she'd just left, with old worn furniture and cobwebs. Jiaojiao quickly located the front door to the building, it wasn't hard, the mean trio hadn't bothered closing the doors after themselves. The pain in her leg was a persistent presence as she leaned against the cracked doorframe and peered outside. \n\nIn the midday light, a neglected courtyard came into view, weeds peeking out from between the flagstones. A half withered apricot tree twisted overhead, casting curled shadows on the walkway. Dead leaves filled the corners of the patchy walls, spotty with flaking limestone plaster and creeping moss. There was even a sizable hole in the wall directly across from her, large enough to stick her head through.  A second and third building, smaller than the main house stood off to the side, in an equal state of disrepair and entropy. A small pond with a wealth of duckweed and choked with clumps of algae completed the depressing scene.\n\nJiaojiao ignored all this in favor of the shabby outhouse in the far corner of the courtyard, also missing roof shingles and with a door that hung crookedly in its frame. \n\n*It'll be fine!* Jiaojiao pep-talked herself, *it will be like camping. We did that once, right?* \n\nIt had been an expensive company retreat with running water, yoga instructors, and h'orderves but *let's not think about that right this second.*\n\nGritting her teeth against the stabbing pain in her right-calf, she shuffled over. It was only about twenty meters but it felt like twenty miles.\n\nAt ten meters, Jiaojiao was already wrinkling her nose at the smell. Delightful. Her face grew ever more pinched with dread as she neared the source of the distinctive aroma. \n\n*It's fine. I'm fine. Everything's--*\n\nShe wrenched open the door and gagged on the stench.¬†\n\nAfter hesitating on the threshold for a good thirty seconds, silently choking on the smell, she finally gathered the remnants of her waning courage and hopped inside, shutting the door behind her. After a nerve-wracking ten seconds, fumbling with the unwieldy folds of her robes, she finished her business, then realized there was no toilet paper. She nearly died of shock on the spot.\n\nFinally, she ripped off a corner of her robes to finally put an end to the horrible affair and dashed outside as quickly as her gimp leg allowed.\n\n\"That's it,\" Jiaojiao announced, incoherent with disgust. \"I can't. Just no.\"\n\nShe drifted back inside the house, muttering to herself. \"Isn't it just dying? I can just do it again.\"\n\n*What are you talking about?* the ball of light floated over, emanating superiority.\n\nJiaojiao looked at it with the gaze of a man recently returned from the front-lines. \n\nBefore Jiaojiao could tear into the ball for sending her to this godforsaken era, a noise came from outside.\n\n\"Aiya! What happened here?\" A high voice cried. \"Young miss! Are you all right? Young miss!\"\n\nRapid footsteps, then a portly old woman dressed in gray robes came into view. Her face was plump with the beginnings of age-spots on her cheeks. Her wrinkled forehead creased with worry as she looked Jiaojiao up and down. \"Yueyue! Did that awful second young miss come by again? You're not hurt are you?\"\n\nThe old woman dropped her basket of vegetables, making tsking noises as she came up to take Jiaojiao's sleeves. \"Why are you wearing your good robe? Why is it ripped? Did the second miss do this?\" \n\n*These are the good robes?*\n\nJiaojiao tried to draw back, alarmed as the old woman took a hank of limp hair and folded it behind Jiaojiao's ear, but the old woman's grip was like iron. She was further dumbfounded when the woman *picked her up* by the elbows and deposited her onto the ruined *kang* not even batting an eye at the two mango-sized holes in the middle of the bed.\n\n\"Don't you worry, Yueyue, I harvested some good bamboo just the other day, you won't have to sleep on the floor tonight.\"\n\n*Sleep on the floor?* Jiaojiao echoed shrilly in her head. *You better fucking believe that's never happening.*\n\nJiaojiao spent the next twenty minutes watching the old woman bustle about, having been deposited onto three-legged stool like a doll. The old woman pulled out an old stone bucket from somewhere and placing it in the middle of the courtyard. She proceeded to light some coals on fire, turning her head away when it spat out plumes of foul smoke.\n\n\"I spent this month's stipend on some charcoal,\" the old woman told her cheerfully. \"You won't have to wear your padded jacket to sleep tonight.\"\n\nJiaojiao had no response to this delightful news.\n\nAs the old woman took out a dented copper pot and and cup of broken rice, Jiaojiao finally identified the old woman from the wealth of text swimming in her head. \n\n\"Cen Wei.\"\n\nThe old woman peered over curiously. \"What is it Yueyue? Are you feeling ill?\"\n\nJiaojiao forced out a smile. \"It's nothing.\"\n\n\"Yueyue! You're smiling!\" The old lady threw down a handful of wilted vegetables and scurried over, frowning in worry. \"You're smiling! Are you sure you're alright?\"\n\n*Damn, how miserable was this Yueyue that a smile would read as a red flag?*\n\nThe old woman fussed over Jiaojiao, turning her this way and that with her inhuman strength. Jiaojiao could only sit there and take it with her stick limbs and bum leg. She shot a pointed look at the ball of light floating off to the side, but it showed no reaction to her distress, seemingly content to watch her be manhandled. Jiaojiao was fast growing tired of being treated like a living doll by this old woman.\n\nAfter the mixture of broken rice and handful of cabbage leaf coagulated into a depressing looking gruel, the woman banked the charcoal fire and ushered Jiaojiao back into the main room. She plopped her onto a flat cushion that has seen better days, jolting a wince out of her as her leg brushed the floor at a bad angle.\n\nWhat followed was the worst meal Jiaojiao had ever had the displeasure of tasting. She hadn't had much expectation seeing the ingredients that had gone into the copper pot, but...\n\n\"Are these worm holes?\" Jiaojiao asked, a tremor in her voice, holding aloft a boiled cabbage leaf with mismatched chopsticks.\n\n\"They were only two bits of copper at market, I got two whole baskets!\" Cen Wei said, yellowed teeth on display with a wide smile. \"We can have vegetables all every meal this week!\"\n\nJiaojiao took one look at that expectant face, seemingly searching for praise, and laughed a little hysterically. \"I'm full,\" she said finally, placing down her bowl on the uneven tea table, the surface pockmarked from years of abuse and missing half its mother-of-pearl inlays.\n\n\"How can you be full?\" Cen Wei asked in disapproval. \"You barely ate.\"\n\n\"Why don't you eat instead?\" Jiaojiao suggested.\n\nThis was apparently the wrong thing to say as Cen Wei's expression fell.\n\n\"Have I done something wrong, miss?\" Cen Wei asked in a wobbly voice, her creased hand coming up to wipe the tears collecting in her eyes. \"I know it's not much, but I tried my best to come up with this meal.\"\n\n\"I'm just not hungry,\" Jiaojiao deflected. \"You did nothing wrong.\"\n\n\"Those bastard kitchen hands cut off our daily meals again! They are too much! I almost thought I would have to beg in the streets so we wouldn't starve!\" Cen Wei slammed a fist on the table. The legs groaned in protest and another inlay popped off the surface, but she paid it no mind, too caught up in her diatribe. \n\n\"Or are you not feeling well because...\" she gave Jiaojiao a commiserating look. \"I didn't want to speak of it, because I know you must feel ashamed, but is this because of what happened yesterday?\" Cen Wei asked with sniff. \"My poor Yueyue! Humiliated in front of half the capital!\"\n\n\"It's not--\"\n\n\"It's that awful first miss!\" Cen Wei said with a wail. \"She set you up! She knew you didn't want to go to the palace feast, but she forced you into the carriage anyway! I know how shy you are about your birthmark! How could you possibly have gone to that feast of your own will!\"\n\nJiaojiao sat back and watched the old woman degenerate into a fretful mess of tears and indignation on behalf of the absent Yueyue. \n\n*So noisy,* Guang Qiu finally spoke.\n\n\"So fake,\" Jiaojiao said.\n\n\"What was that, Yueyue?\" Cen Wei said, looking at her sharply.\n\n\"Nothing, nothing,\" Jiaojiao said with a thin smile. \"I was just saying how I don't feel like eating because of what happened yesterday.\"\n\nCen Wei stared at Jiaojiao for a long time, expression clouded. \"Yes, Yueyue must still be in shock, after all you almost died in that pond.\"\n\nJiaojiao forced herself to eat the thin gruel, nibbling on a few mouthfuls of bitter cabbage leaves before the appalling meal finally drew to a close. Cen Wei didn't urge her to eat more, taking away the half-full bowl. \n\nShe murmured some excuse about being tired, then excused herself to her room, maneuvering the broken door back into its frame with a grunt of effort.\n\n\"Guang Qiu,\" Jiaojiao said, when she was sure Cen Wei wasn't listening in.\n\n*What?* the ball asked, having retired to the inner chambers with her.\n\n\"Don't tell me you didn't notice?\" Jiaojiao asked incredulously.\n\n*Notice what?*\n\n\"Are you blind? There's something wrong with Cen Wei.\"","lastmodified":"2022-04-15T11:37:36.43780101Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/Chapter04-Cen-Wei-the-Suspicious":{"title":"Chapter 01-Cen Wei the Suspicious","content":"*What are you doing?*\n\nJiaojiao ignored the ball of light in favor of peeking through one of the many holes in the front window. The old woman, Cen Wei, was cheerfully puttering about in the courtyard. Jiaojiao watched with morbid curiosity as the woman went into one of the other buildings and came out with a wooden bucket, a shovel and a length of cloth tied around her face. The woman disappeared into the horrific outhouse Jiaojiao was still suffering ongoing flashbacks about with her implements.\n\n\"What is *she* doing?\" Jiaojiao asked. \n\n*You are behaving oddly. I see nothing wrong with the old woman?*\n\nJiaojiao didn't reply, busy going over what she knew of Cen Wei from the godawful text in her mind. Cen Wei didn't have much of a presence in The Cold Prince Loves Me Dearly. The sum of her parts was less than five thousand words, a pitiful count in comparison to characters such as Bai Xingwu who had upwards of sixty thousand words describing her interactions with Bai Jing.\n\nCen Wei was the wet-nurse of Bai Xingyue's mother-- well, her supposed mother, Mu Haoru-- lets not get into that mess right now. But she was a devoted servant from the past generation and had taken care of Bai Xingyue all her life. Despite this, she didn't show doubt at Bai Xingyue's sudden change in personality when Bai Jing took over. Instead, citing her change as her young miss having \"finally grown up.\" She was a sycophantic presence next to the transmigrated Bai Jing, never saying a word against this new version of her young miss. Even curiouser, she never once doubted Bai Jing's strength, despite Bai Xingyue being a lifelong cripple with no martial training. From beginning to end, Cen Wei was described as a loyal if somewhat dull-witted servant.\n\nCurious.\n\nCen Wei came out of the outhouse five minutes later, bucket full of... Jiaojiao surpressed her churning stomach. \"You seriously don't see it? This old woman is *suss*.\"\n\n*What?*\n\n\"She's a servant. If she truly cared for her master then why was this body still wearing the wet clothes after nearly drowning? Isn't it common sense that a person should change clothes after getting them wet? Yet this poor girl lay in soggy clothes all night. There's something wrong with your book.\"\n\n*So the servant is lazy, it doesn't mean the book is wrong.*\n\nAnother thin smile. \"Sure hon. But I haven't even gotten to this old woman's real odd points. I mean, just look at her.\"\n\nThe was a pause as the ball took an irritated glance at the old woman, now swishing the defiled shovel in the courtyard pond. *I see nothing odd about her.*\n\n\"Look at her, and look at this body,\" Jiaojiao held up a feeble wrist. \"What loyal servant is that plump while her master starves? I call bullshit.\"\n\n*...perhaps it's simply a difference of physique?*\n\nJiaojiao was beginning to think that Guang Qiu wasn't very bright despite his luminous appearance. \"Yeah? And what about these hands? Just look at these nails!\"\n\nA chipped nail was thrust in front of Guang Qiu like a piece of case-breaking evidence.\n\n*...what about them?*\n\n\"Um, hello? She's supposed to be the master? Why do her hands look worse than the old lady's? You don't get hands like these unless you're doing hard labor, like handwashing clothes in the dead of winter or something.\"\n\nThere was a considering air emanating from the ball. *Perhaps you have a point.*\n\nJiaojiao smiled--\n\n*But that still doesn't mean the book was wrong. There's nothing here that says that the old woman wasn't simply avoiding her duties. It doesn't mean she is disloyal at heart.* The ball insisted, though it didn't seem quite as certain as before.\n\nJiaojiao rolled her eyes. \"I haven't even mentioned the most damning piece of evidence. This one is even backed up by your precious book.\"\n\n*What evidence?*\n\n\"Bai Xingyue's poison,\" Jiaojiao said with a smirk. \"This girl is being poisoned right? Where do you think it's coming from?\"\n\n*I don't follow.*\n\n\"Do I have to spell it out for you? Are you an idiot? Do you even have two brain cells to rub together?\"\n\n*You dare insult my intelligence--*\n\n\"Cen Wei herself said the kitchens are withholding rations. Where is the poison coming from?\" Jiaojiao spoke as if to a very slow child.\n\nThere was a long, excruciating pause.\n\n*The poison comes from Head Wife Zhang. It says so in the book.*\n\n\"Yeah, but how is it getting to Bai Xingyue, you dumb brick?\"\n\nAnother sullen pause. *Very well, perhaps your suspicions are not totally groundless.*\n\n\"Good lord, he can be taught. Speaking of poison,\" Jiaojiao said. \"How exactly do you plan on ridding me of it? It'll be hilarious if after all this talk the body simply keels over. Keels over again, I mean.\"\n\n*Because you are an entertainer with no training in the medical arts, I will have to find an alternative way to cure you of the poison currently plaguing you.* \n\n\"Sure, whatever.\"\n\nAs they spoke, Cen Wei had disappeared from view with her bucket of... leavings. Perhaps this would lead to a marginal improvement in smell, though Jiaojiao wasn't getting her hopes up. She wasn't too curious about where those leavings were going to end up. Nope.\n\n\"Anyway, Guang Qiu--\" Jiaojiao ignored the ball as it bristled at its moniker \"--if I learn to cultivate, does that I no longer have to use the bathroom?\"\n\n*What does that have to do with anything?*\n\n\"I don't expect you to understand, since you are but a disembodied orb, but this matter has a direct relation to my sanity, so please answer the question.\"\n\n*...once you reach Jindan stage, you will be able to exist solely on spirit energy, thus negating the need to defecate.*\n\n\"Sweet. I'll keep that in mind.\"\n\n*Perhaps we should now speak of your next move. Given that you're not capable of curing yourself, you'll need to find a doctor. You must fix your leg as soon as possible if you are to keep up with the timeline in the book.*\n\n\"Ugh, do we have to talk about this now?\" Jiaojiao protested. \"I need a bath and a *real* change of clothes, where can I find those? And I haven't even seen what I look like yet! Am I ugly? This body is pretty ugly, right?\"\n\nThe ball seemed out of patience as it began to emanate an unseen pressure.\n\n\"Don't emote me! Like you can understand when you don't even have a body. Why don't we switch places and I can be the judgmental presence hovering over you instead?\"\n\n*Don't waste your time wishing for the impossible, mortal!*\n\n\"Whatever, I--\" Jiaojiao paused. \"Did you see that?\"\n\n*What is it now?*\n\nJiaojiao stared intently at the hole in the courtyard wall. She could have sworn she saw a face peeking into the yard. Before she could speak again, Cen Wei barged into the room, lugging a large wooden tub. Jiaojiao's eyes lit up.\n\n\"Nevermind, it's nothing.\"\n\nWhat followed was a highly uncomfortable bath with lukewarm water, supervised by an overzealous servant that insisted on scrubbing her from head to toe with a sponge that felt more like a pumice stone. Jiaojiao tried several times to shoo Cen Wei away, unable to forget that those same hands scrubbing her body were engaged in far fouler chores less than an hour ago, and she had yet to see Cen Wei break out an antibacterial soap, but the old servant was not to be deterred. \n\nShe was far less concerned about her own nakedness. Jiaojiao didn't feel modesty, she after all, was not in her own body, and even if she were, she had long had modesty drummed out of her by her profession as an \"entertainer.\" Jiaojiao finally got a closer look at her new body, and she did not like it one bit. \n\nBai Xingyue was distressingly skinny, akin to pictures of starving refuges Jiaojiao had seen on the news or in documentaries. There were strange red striations around her joints. Curious, she'd pushed on them and felt a spreading numbness. She wanted answers, but Guang Qiu had long excused themselves and Jiaojiao couldn't very well ask Cen Wei the Poisoner, as she caught the servant looking at her with questioning eyes.\n\n\"Is something wrong, Yueyue?\"\n\n\"Nothing, just cold,\" Jiaojiao said, ducking her head to hide a repulsed shiver.\n\nCen Wei spread a few crumbs of inferior quality *zao dou*, or \"bath beans\" that gave off a weak lather. Jiaojiao was very interested in the ancient soap, given that she was a sucker for vegan beauty products, but seeing Cen Wei's strange look as she handled the soap sent her inner curiosity deflating. \n\nAfter the awkward affair, Cen Wei left to dispose of the bathwater while Jiaojiao changed into clothes she reluctantly deemed tolerable, if not acceptable. Homeless chic was *never* a good look in her mind, but what could you do when you were the disgraced and bullied second miss of a cold, impersonal clan?\n\nGuang Qiu reappeared the moment Jiaojiao was dressed, sending her impatient vibes. *You mortals are so troublesome.*\n\n\"Yes, yes, spare me the lecture about mortal filth,\" Jiaojiao said.\n\n\"Who are you talking to, Yueyue?\" Cen Wei asked with a concerned frown, craning her head around the broken door. \n\n\"Nobody, just talking myself.\"\n\n*You don't have to speak aloud,* Guang Qiu said with condescension. *I can hear your thoughts.*\n\n\"No you can't,\" Jiaojiao said. \"If you could, you'd be far angrier with me.\"\n\n*I can hear thoughts you direct at me.* \n\n*Can you hear this, sad rave?* Jiaojiao thought cautiously, not attempting to \"send\" thoughts.\n\n*Brainless nightlight,* she thought with slightly more intent.\n\n*Discount disco,* she tried again when Guang Qui showed no reaction.\n\n*What,* if Guang Qiu had teeth, Jiaojiao didn't doubt she would have heard them grinding that very moment. *Is a disco.*\n\nJiaojiao's reply was interrupted as Cen Wei returned with a comb with missing teeth and a battered bronze mirror. \"Yueyue, come here, let me dry your hair.\"\n\nJiaojiao dutifully sat on the ground by the low table and Cen Wei placed the dented mirror in front of her. It looked much like something that should be on exhibit at a museum, complete with an ages worth of scratches and shedding teal flakes of oxidation. The servant had a strange glint in her eye and Jiaojiao didn't have long to wonder why as she got a look at the face in the mirror.\n\nBai Jing in the webnovel had been described as a world-stopping beauty, both before her death and as her reincarnation in Bai Xingyue's body. The face in the mirror however, lacked any sort of grace or enviable qualities so extoled by the author. There was no smooth skin, or brilliant eyes shining with determination or haughtiness inherent to those confident in their own worth. There was no lustrous black hair or red ruby lips. No oval-shaped face, or long, curled lashes, like that of a butterfly's wing.\n\nThere reflected in the bronze was a small, weak girl, a large, muddy-red stain marred the left half of her face, covering most of her forehead, cutting down across the middle of her face, lashing her nosebridge and over her left eye. Most of her left cheek was similarly discolored and the stain went on to cover most of her ear and extend into her hairline. The mark was a deep maroon, mottled, and had strange squiggly marks like veins.\n\nJiaojiao raised a hand and placed in on the mark, deep in thought. Cen Wei spoke by her ear. \"Don't be sad, miss, you are still very beautiful in my heart.\"\n\n*If you knew she would be sad, why put the mirror in front of her, you sadistic old biddy.* If Jiaojiao still had doubts about Cen Wei's attitude about her charge, they were thoroughly dispelled in this second. She actually sounded happy at the thought that the young girl would be distressed by her own ugliness.\n\nUnfortunately, Jiaojiao was here, and Jiaojiao, though self-confessed to be incurably vain, wasn't stupid enough to confuse her own face with the face of the stranger in the mirror. And more importantly, wasn't Bai Jing able to dispel this mark from her face with relative ease? It hadn't even taken her five chapters in fact.\n\nBut what did Guang Qiu think of all this? Jiaojiao shot it a meaningful glance, but it hovered there, unaffected by the scene of an old woman tormenting a young girl with her own inadequacies. Whatever, she evidently expected too much from that idiot. \n\n*Oy, what do you think of the old woman?* Jiaojiao prodded.\n\n*What is there to say? Isn't she being kind by combing your hair? She is simply doing her job as your servant.*\n\nRiiiight. *Sure hon. Whatever you say.*\n\nCen Wei carefully, lovingly even, combed through the tangles of Jiaojiao's thin locks. Given malnutrition and lack of modern hair products, or any hair products really, the girl's hair wasn't in great condition. Jiaojiao grabbed a handful of split ends and grimaced. Nothing short of a haircut could save this mess, unfortunately, if the ancient standards of the world were consistent, then it would be considered an unfilial crime to cut ones hair. \n\nNot that something like that was going to stop Jiaojiao from doing *what needed to be done.*\n\nJiaojiao took another look at the face in the mirror. Cen Wei had started humming behind her, a cheerful tune that grated on her nerves and she did her best to ignore her. The face had potential, Jiaojiao admitted. The book author wasn't completely talking out of her ass when she described Bai Jing as a beauty to end all beauties. The bone structure was good, with delicate, high cheekbones, and underneath the mark, the skin was even in spite of the illusion given by the squiggling, veinlike marks. \n\nYes, she could work with this. Given her occupation, she would be embarrassed if she couldn't work with such material. Even if the little girl *had* been plain, it wouldn't have made a differences A good diet, some exercise-- after that damned leg was fixed-- and some make-up magic, what heart-stopping beauty couldn't she make?\n\nBesides, the mark wasn't natural to begin with, not a birthmark as said in rumors, but a poison, courtesy of Head Wife Zhang. Some more inter-house drama she wasn't looking forward to navigating but...\n\n*What are you going to do about the poison?* Jiaojiao asked Guang Qiu in her head, prodding the mark. *Bai Jing had that magical inheritance to help her, but I don't have that, do I?*\n\nGuang Qiu paused, having realized he had overlooked yet another, very important detail.\n\n*That's... Guang Qiu stalled, apparently at a loss.\n\nShe shook her head, wincing as Cen Wei's comb caught on a difficult knot.\n\n*I'll think of something.* \n\nJiaojiao almost felt sorry for the dumb thing. It was clearly baling water out of a sinking ship.","lastmodified":"2022-04-15T11:37:36.43780101Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/Chapter05-Bai-Jings-Artifact":{"title":"Chapter 05-Bai Jing's Artifact","content":"Cen Wei soon finished combing Jiaojiao's hair and retreated with the dented mirror, smile a touch smugger than before. Jiaojiao didn't care to speculate on the old woman's inner thoughts, as poisonous as they must be.\n\nGuang Qiu went back to its silence, content to float there, unassuming, at least, until Cen Wei came back, arms laden with bamboo strips.\n\n\"What's this?\" Cen Wei suddenly said with surprise.\n\nJiaojiao looked over to see the old woman holding a delicately carved bangle in her thick palm. It was made of a shimmery pear wood and seemed far too small to fit on her stout wrist.\n\n*That's--!*\n\nCen Wei turned the bracelet this way and that, giving Jiaojiao an inquisitive look. \"Where did this come from?\"\n\n*If my suspicions are correct...* thought Jiaojiao.\n\n*Grab it!* Guang Qiu suddenly screamed in her mind, loud enough to cause Jiaojiao to jolt in alarm.\n\n\"That's mine,\" Jiaojiao said instead with a careful expression. \"Can I have it back, please?\"\n\nCen Wei gave her a considering stare, hands rubbing the exquisite bracelet between her hands. \"This looks expensive.\"\n\n\"It's really not,\" Jiaojiao said. \"It's fake. I got it for a few coppers.\"\n\nThe furrow between the servant's brows deepened. \"When did you buy it? You never leave the estate.\"\n\n*Woops.* \"I asked another servant to buy it for me.\"\n\nCen Wei didn't look like she believed her. \"Where did you get the money? Who did you ask?\"\n\n*This servant really dared.* \"Does it matter where I got the money? Now give it to me.\" Jiaojiao held out her hand, palm up.\n\n\"Yueyue!\" Cen Wei looked scandalized. \"How can a young lady speak like that?\"\n\nThe bracelet disappeared  into her sleeve. \"Don't worry, I will keep this safe for you. You know how forgetful you are! Wouldn't want you to lose such a pretty thing! You know how things sometimes disappear around you.\"\n\n*Aided largely in part by a certain servant, I would imagine.* Jiaojiao thought sardonically.\n\n*What are you sitting there for?!* Guang Qiu screamed. *Just take it from her, she's but an old woman!*\n\nJiaojiao stood.\n\n*Wait!* \n\nJiaojiao smirked and sat back down.\n\n*You can't get into a conflict with her,* Guang Qiu said, sounding annoyed. *It would derail the plot too much.*\n\n\"I must say, you are behaving very oddly!\" Cen Wei scolded. \"I know you must not be very happy after humiliating yourself, but this is no reason to misbehave!\"\n\n*You will have to take it from her unnoticed,* Guang Qiu said wearily. *You cannot allow your relationship with her to sour.*\n\n*The woman is already poisoning me,* Jiaojiao laughed inwardly. *Could the relationship be worse?*\n\nCen Wei had gone back to stripping the broken bamboo slats from the kang, apparently not feeling even a moment of shame for brazenly stealing from her mistress.\n\n*This impudent servant!* Guang Qiu roared, floating around the old woman and swirling in agitation.\n\nIn shortly less than an hour, Cen Wei had patched the bed, deft fingers flying over the frame, evidently used to performing such repairs. Jiaojiao had to wonder how often Bai Xingwu had ruined Bai Xingyue's bed specifically for Cen Wei to become so adept.\n\n*We cannot allow that old woman to get away with that bracelet. It is Bai Jing's artifact!*\n\n*I figured. You wouldn't go batshit over some random piece of jewelry.* Jiaojiao bounced carefully on the newly repaired *kang*. *Speaking of which, why is the bracelet here? If it belongs to Bai Jing, then doesn't that mean she showed up after all?*\n\nGuang Qiu was silent. Digesting this piece of news. \n\n*Unless of course, you're wrong and that bracelet is just an ordinary piece of jewelry.*\n\n*No, I cannot be wrong about this,* Guang Qiu said. *I don't know why it is here, but this is good news for you. You will be able to heal your leg and cure your poison with that bracelet.*\n\nBai Jing's bracelet was far from as simple as its appearance suggested. Her mother, the latest heir to an ancient mystical clan, famous for their skills in Chinese medicine, had gifted it to Bai Jing shortly before being murdered by her husband, Bai Jing's father, for control of the Bai family-- not to be confused with the Shaofu realm Bai Family. Anyway, it was all Very Sad.\n\nBai Jing hid away the bracelet, having been told by her mother that it harbored a very special secret. All through the years she was consigned to a death camp by her own father, she never spoke of it, despite his repeated attempts to persuade the answer out of her. After all, Bai Jing had been the sole witness to her mothers murder at her father's hands. \n\nBai Jing could only watch helplessly as her father took control of her mother's clan and all its businesses. Could only look as her father swiftly married his secret mistress, even bringing home a half-sister the same age as her. Could only keep to herself and plot revenge in the dark while her half-sister lived in the light, taking everything that should have been hers.\n\nShe guarded against this den of vipers all her life, building up her own strength, hoping one day to burst out with a revenge worthy of the history books. She honed her skills killing her targets, each time imagining her own father's face as she cut them down, even as every move she made was at the discretion of *that man*. She spent every free moment learning about medicine, both western and eastern, not wanting to shame her clan's legacy, planning for the day when she would wrench control of the clan from her father's cold dead hands.\n\nWho knew that half-sister would send her lover to seduce Bai Jing in a strange bid for the rumored inheritance of the mystical Bai Family, causing Bai Jing to trip up in the dumbest way possible.\n\nHaving lost her life in such a hackneyed, cliched manner, Bai Jing was luckily saved by her mother's artifact. Inside slept a celestial tiger, which whisked her soul away to the world of Shaofu, where she was reborn as the crippled girl, Bai Xingyue.\n\nThe bracelet was a magical item that harbored a secret space inside that defied common sense. It had various features such as the ability to store food indefinitely with no chance of it degrading. Plants grew faster in this pocket dimension as well, and there was even a luxurious pavilion with a library of secret martial arts texts. Plants grew faster in the soil, an advantage that Bai Jing exploited throughout her career dominating the world of Shaofu. She would use the space to nurture medicinal plants, supplying her alchemy with an endless crop of ingredients. Not to mention there was a celestial tiger that would become Bai Jing's willing lackey and body guard during her more vulnerable days.\n\nIn other words, the space was an indispensable part of Bai Jing's strength.\n\n*Tonight, when she has gone to bed, you will sneak into her room--*\n\n*Oh sure,* Jiaojiao said. *Just watch me, I'll be shadow itself with this bum leg.*\n\n*Bai Jing would--*\n\nJiaojiao massaged her forehead. *Not Bai Jing, Hello? Have you been paying attention at all?*\n\nGuang Qiu's light levels dimmed, and the room simmered in its discontent. *You will get that bracelet one way or another. You must. Or I will get rid of you.*\n\nJiaojiao covered her mouth as a yawn forced tears from her eyes. \"Can I do it later? I'm tired. Besides, she said she's going out for errands and it's not like this body is capable of running her down.\"\n\nThe ball's angry reply was lost as Jiaojiao laid back on the *kang* and fell asleep in a daze. \n\n*Isekai. Why did I have to be isekai'ed?* Jiaojiao's tired mind spiraled, confused. *Clearly I haven't even brushed the bumper of a white truck or crossed paths with an insane slasher? Why me? Isn't this sort of bullshit supposed to happen to virgin salarymen?*\n\nJiaojiao hadn't had a perfect life, but it was damn close. She was rich, famous, and admired by 13 million fans at the lastest count. She didn't lack for anything. She was a trust-fund baby for fucks sake, she didn't have any of the hallmarks typical of isekai victims. She wasn't disastified with the status quo. She had no outstanding traumas. She wasn't bullied, aside from some of the more poisonous voices denoucing her as shallow, fake, etc, she hadn't encountered much negativity at all. In fact, she was often praised for being young and successful--though some bitter voices would attribute all her accomplishments to her background as the young heir to the huge MEI conglomerate.\n\nShe had friends. Well, maybe they weren't quite as genuine as some, but she had a wide circle of acquaintances who were (somewhat) invested in her wellbeing. And she had...\n\nDevika. She had forgotten Devika. She had to ask Guang Qiu if she was okay. If whatever killed her had killed Devika too, then where was she?\n\nHow had she died anyway? She hadn't had the chance to ask Guang Qiu in all the chaotic aftermath of her sudden transmigration.\n\n*Isn't transmigration trendy?* Jiaojiao thought, somewhat hysterically to herself. *And I pride myself on being trendy, right? Maybe it's a little tired, but people still like reading about it, right?*\n\nThe kang creaked as Jiaojiao's body turned fitfully, her mind unable to rest as she fell deeper into dreams. \n\n*She looks out the broken window, rubble crumbling over the edges of the sill. Dust lingered in the cracks and crevices between the stones. Ivy trails curled and spun over the walls. She sees a shimmering valley in the distance, but she knows there is nothing there for her. She turns away and treads familiar steps down the corridor, shattered stone litters the path but she steps over them with practiced footwork.*\n\n*Checkered sunlight streams across the hall. Dusty footprints chase her steps. Not a sound is made. She comes to a door, half open, half closed. She pushes past and walks inside into a room with only one occupant. He is waiting for her, as he always is.*\n\n*I died today. But you weren't there.*\n\n*He doesn't speak. He never does. But he smiles.*\n\nJiaojiao woke in a start as someone shook her awake.\n\n\"Yueyue! Did you sleep well?\"\n\nJiaojiao held her head, still half lost in dreams. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\"Yueyue,\" Cen Wei shook her again, rougher this time. \"It's time for dinner.\"\n\nGuang Qiu popped into existence by her ear just as Jiaojiao was about to take her first bite.\n\n*Don't eat it. There's poison!*\n\nJiaojiao ignored it and took a difficult mouthful of worm-eaten cabbage.\n\nThe ball seemed shocked into silence. For all of two seconds. Then it screamed. *What are you doing?! Did you not hear me, mortal? Poison! I said there is poison!*\n\n*I heard you.* Jiaojiao shot back irritably. *What do you think the old woman would do if I refused to eat? Didn't you say I had to keep a good relationship with her for The Plot? Besides, this body is on the verge of keeling over from starvation. If you want me to be of any use, don't I need the strength?*\n\n*You are eating poison,* the ball retorted. *It's already killing you. I did a scan of your body as you slept--*\n\n*Um, invasive much?*\n\n*And the body is not long for this world if the rate of poison is not stemmed.*\n\n*Well, the body has been poisoned all its life,* Jiaojiao reasoned. *One more meal won't kill it.*\n\nGuang Qiu grumbled some more, but didn't refute this.\n\nJiaojiao choked down another half bowl of gruel before she couldn't force herself to go on, honestly she was proud that she had done as well as she had.\n\n*This has been the worst day of my life,* Jiaojiao told the ball with a dreary resignation as she watched Cen Wei rinse out the bowl in a bucket of well water-- not the same bucket she had used earlier that day thankfully. \n\n*You are too pampered,* the ball sneered. *You call this much suffering? How soft you are.*\n\nJiaojiao didn't argue. She was indeed a pampered, soft, and delicate existence. The worst thing she'd eaten prior to today had been a slightly sour yogurt she'd left in the fridge too long.\n\n\"Cen Wei,\" Jiaojiao said suddenly. \"Can I see a doctor about my leg?\"\n\nThis entreaty was enough for Cen Wei to drop a bowl. It shattered in half on the cobblestones and the pieces wobbled back and forth, emitting sounds like jeering laughter.\n\n\"What?\" Cen Wei, eyes wide. \"You want to fix your leg?\"\n\n\"Is something wrong?\" Jiaojiao asked. \n\n\"You can't!\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"There--\" Cen Wei licked her lips. \"There's no money.\"\n\nJiaojiao didn't speak.\n\n\"Besides, why would you want to fix your leg? It's been so long, miss. I'm afraid...\"\n\nThe rest went unspoken, but the implication was there. That the leg was too far gone to fix. That she should be content to spend the rest of her life a cripple. Cen Wei's deliberately bitter smile was ripe with untold sympathy.\n\n*Hey she makes a good point,* Jiaojiao said to Guang Qiu. *We're broke.*\n\nJiaojiao could almost hear the ball's scream of frustration.\n\n*We will cross that bridge when we come to it.* \n\nJiaojiao shrugged, then hobbled toward the outhouse.\n\n\"Do you need help, young miss?\" Cen Wei said, relief evident in her voice that her master had dropped the subject.\n\n\"I'll be fine,\" Jiaojiao said.\n\nGuang Qiu had excused itself the second Jiaojiao made moves toward the outhouse, no doubt afraid of mortal filth. But Jiaojiao didn't enter the outhouse. Instead, she hesitated for a long, long moment before picking up the three-foot long shovel leaning against the side, expression fraught with distress.\n\nShe hefted the smooth handle, trying her damndest to ignore the stench wafting off the rusted iron head. Flecks of... matter remained despite its bath earlier in the day. *Don't think about it, don't think about it.*\n\nCen Wei was still scrubbing dishes when Jiaojiao quietly came up behind her and whacked her in the head with the shovel. She fell forward, but caught herself on the edge of the bucket in front of her. Expression livid, she turned in time to catch the second hit with her forehead. \n\n\"Yueyue!\" She screamed, holding her face. Jiaojiao hit her again. It took five hits before the old woman finally slumped over into unconciousness.\n\nJiaojiao frowned, looking at the old woman collapsed facedown on the ground, then the shovel. \"What the hell is her head made of?\"\n\nGuang Qiu chose this moment to pop back into existence. *Mortal! What have you done!?*","lastmodified":"2022-04-15T11:37:36.43780101Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/Chapter06-The-Impasse":{"title":"Chapter 06-The Impasse","content":"Jiaojiao tossed the shovel aside with revulsion and wiped her stinging hands on Cen Wei's gray robes, paying no mind to Guang Qiu's enraged screams ringing in her mind.\n\n*Mortal! Didn't I say not to get in conflict with the old woman? Why did you attack her, you imbecile?!*\n\n*Sometimes I really do wonder if you have two brain cells to rub together, or whether you have braincells at all,* Jiaojiao retorted as she flipped the woman around with difficulty. She summoned all eighty-five pounds of leverage, sweat beading on her brow. *Perhaps you don't have a brain at all in that child's nightlight you call a body.*\n\n*Now what will happen to the fateline?* Guang Qiu seemed to be mostly talking to itself. *It's already bad enough that the scene with Bai Xingwu didn't go as intended!*\n\nJiaojiao rifled in the the woman's sleeves, but came up empty. *The bracelet isn't in her sleeves.* She informed Guang Qiu.\n\nA small bout of distressed silence. *Then go look for it! Doesn't she live in the other hovel over there?*\n\n*I can't just leave her here. What if she wakes up and comes after me?*\n\nGuang Qiu's grumbling reached a deafening crescendo as Jiaojiao ventured into the storehouse, the third building in the courtyard. She squinted in the low light of the setting sun and located a coil of moldy rope on a low shelf and sneezed when picking it up raised a small cloud of dust. Waving a hand in front of her face, she retreated with the heavy length of hemp rope, most likely reserved for roof repairs.\n\nShe spent the next ten to fifteen minutes securing Cen Wei's prone form, binding her arms close to her body and tying her legs together. She was thankful Bai Xingyue's courtyard was deserted, not knowing how she would explain herself should someone stumble onto the scene of her binding her unconscious servant.\n\n*This is not good,* Guang Qiu fretted. *What of the plot?*\n\n*For real? You should just accept that the plot had been miscarried the moment you decided to yeet me into this body,* Jiaojiao said, tying off the last the rope and clapping the filth off her hands. *Besides, we would have had to make a move against her sooner or later.*\n\n*I fail to see your reasoning. Bai Jing managed to keep an amiable relationship with the old woman, why couldn't you do the same?*\n\nJiaojiao was once again reminded that Guang Qiu wasn't the most farsighted of beings. *My guess is that Cen Wei was always rotten, but when Bai Jing showed up, she frightened Cen Wei into hiding her true nature when she beat up Bai Xingwu.*\n\n*So this is your fault!* The ball cried.\n\n*Hey, don't try to blame this on me. You're the one who put me here knowing I was but an \"entertainer,\" what exactly did you expect? That I would subdue them with my eyelash curlers?*\n\n*I still think it would have been better to sneak into her room--*\n\n*God, you just never quit! Even if I somehow managed to get the bracelet from her, what then? You saw her attitude. She would have likely detained us if we tried to leave. How would we get this leg fixed if we were confined to the courtyard? Even with the magic bracelet, I have no medical training. You expect me to fix this leg myself? And I highly doubt she would have been kind enough to invite a doctor. Besides... if my thoughts are correct...*\n\nJiaojiao once again turned a deaf ear to Guang Qiu's complaints as she pushed open the door to the servant's quarters. She thought she would be met with more depressing sights of decrepitude and poverty, but she was surprised to find Cen Wei's room to be in good condition-- at least compared to the rooms she'd spend the day in.\n\n*Tsk, this old woman sure had double standards,* Jiaojiao laughed as she took in the fluffy covers on the servant's *kang*. They weren't silk, like the ones on Bai Xingyue's bed, but at least the cotton wasn't half-eaten by moths or damp with pond water. The space was simple, but the furniture was in good repair, with a minimal amount of wear. Though of simpler make than the furniture in Bai Xingyue's quarters, they were at least not on the verge of falling apart with a slight bump.\n\nBai Xingyue really had lived an unjust life. Even her servant lived better than her. The ceiling didn't even have as many missing roof tiles. Jiaojiao even wondered if Cen Wei had misappropriated some of her mistresses roofing tiles for her own abode.\n\nThe covers were turned over as Jiaojiao searched for the thing she suspected was secreted away by Cen Wei.\n\n*Found it,* Jiaojiao said with a smile.\n\n*Well done, mortal, you found the artifact?*\n\n*No,* Jiaojiao held up the embroidered pouch, heavy and clinking in her hands. *Cash.*\n\n*You imbecile, how can this mortal pittance compare with the magical space--*\n\n*Hey idiot? Do you think doctors work for free? I'm guessing subsidized healthcare isn't a thing here.*\n\nA sullen hum. *What of the artifact?*\n\nJiaojiao turned over the rest of Cen Wei's items, but unfortunately the bracelet was nowhere to be found.\n\n*My guess is that the old woman pawned it this afternoon when she left. She really didn't waste any time. Some of the silver here is what she got in return,* Jiaojiao bounced the heavy pouch in her hands.\n\n*That old wretch! Now we have to waste more time tracking it down.* Guang Qiu cried. *I've a mind to do away with her!*\n\nJiaojiao smiled. *Do away?*\n\n*Yes,* the ball said to itself. *If she remains, it will be more of a problem. Go on, you've already done the damage when you decided to create a hostile relationship with her. Just go out and... hit her a few more times. You won't even have to risk your life.*\n\n*I'm not killing someone,* Jiaojiao said.\n\n*What?!* Guang Qiu drew back, as if the declaration against murder was somehow offensive. *What do you mean?*\n\n*I'm not a murderer,* Jiaojiao said. *You're not going to convince me to kill someone.*\n\n*You already hit her, what difference does it make if you hit her again?*\n\n*Uh, loads. I'm not going to get into this debate with you.*\n\n*This is a ridiculous conversation.*\n\n*Wow! Something we can agree on!*\n\n*If you hope to survive in this world, you will have to get over your squeamishness. You can't avoid killing forever. Bai Jing would have done it without even blinking.*\n\n*I'm getting really sick of hearing about Bai Jing. If she's so great, why isn't she here? Why am I stuck with her problems? Why am I stuck here with you?*\n\n*Don't forget, mortal, I am the sole reason you live and breath! You cannot defy me!*\n\n*Oh yeah? Go ahead, smite me. Just punish me for refusing to kill some defenseless old woman.*\n\nGuang Qiu didn't move.\n\n*You can't, can you? For all your blustering you can't do jack. If you could, you would have punished me already for not listening to you earlier.*\n\n*Mortal...*\n\n*This mortal doesn't have to do anything she doesn't want to. And she doesn't want to kill. So seriously, fuck off.*\n\n*Mortal, you will think twice before crossing me!* The ball warned.\n\n*I already have. And I don't think you're that much at all,* Jiaojiao scoffed. *You haven't done a thing to me since I woke up but scream at me to do things. And for what? With the threat of death? Newsflash, buddy! I'm already dead!*\n\n*You are alive right now.*\n\n*No, I'm pretty sure I'm fucking dead, and this is hell, with scenarios engineered just to torture me. No running water, no internet, no take-out, and everyone, EVERYONE, IS TRYING TO KILL ME.*\n\nJiaojiao was tired of it. She prided herself on her composure, but enough was enough. She had used an outhouse for gods sake. She'd touched a poo shovel with her bare hands. She'd eaten worm food. She'd even kowtowed today! What the hell was that?? She didn't know, but it wasn't living.\n\n*Besides, even if I do what you say, what's in it for me?* Jiaojiao shook her head. *Don't even try to con me with \"you get to live, mortal\" or some shit.*\n\nGuang Qiu vibrated, then fell silent.\n\n*I don't get anything out of listening to you, but more of this. And let me be real with you, it's not enough.*\n\n*Then what do you want?*\n\nBingo. *Well, is it possible for me to be sent back to my own worl--*\n\n*Impossible!* The ball said immediately. *I don't have the power to do so.*\n\n*That's going to be a tough sell for me, man.* Jiaojiao scoffed. *You pulled my soul over, don't tell me you can't send me back. I told you not to bullshit me.*\n\n*You don't understand,* the ball explained irately. *The passage between worlds is usually closed. Even today was a very rare case when the celestial bodies aligned just so. It was enough for Bai Jing to slip through. When she didn't come, and the passage was moments from closing, we had to take measures to find a comparable soul to fill her place.*\n\n*Comparable?* Jiaojiao pointed at herself. *You're saying me and Bai Jing are comparable? In what way?*\n\nRealizing he might have said too much, Guang Qiu hunkered down. *None of your business, mortal.*\n\n*That's interesting,* Jiaojiao said. *That is to say there are souls of different calibers? What is the criteria? It can't be that an assassin and an... entertainer have much in common at all, yet you used the word comparable. Intriguing.*\n\n*Stop thinking so much!*\n\nJiaojiao began to think. What did she have in common with Bai Jing? Certainly, neither of them could be considered average people. They were both *intelligent, beautiful,* and influential young women, both famous in their own circles, both rich, both Chinese-- though Jiaojiao only qualified by half, being a mix-breed with a Russian father. They were both skilled in their fields, though Guang Qiu would probably sneer to compare the art of blending foundation, to the art of the garrote.\n\nWas that where the similarities ended? Not really. \n\nFor one, they both had an ancient ancestry, though the earthly Bai Family (again, not to be confused with the Bai Family of Lan country) bore a mystical background as ancient practitioners of medicine. The MEI conglomerate's origins were far more mundane. They were businessmen, or merchants to use the more archaic term, a social class that was at the very bottom in ancient China, often met with censure and derision. And this attitude had not changed until the last two centuries or so. \n\nThen what were the differences? Not as much as the similarities anyway. Bai Jing had suffered from a childhood of abuse while Jiaojiao had been raised in the lap of luxury. This was the biggest difference between them, Jiaojiao thought. Bai Jing was used to suffering, and Jiaojiao, well. She was used to going with the path of least resistance. If there was an easier way, then that was the way she was going. Why suffer needlessly, after all?\n\nIf Jiaojiao had to put it crudely, they were both one in a million in terms of their life experiences.\n\nIn other words, people like them didn't just die everyday.\n\n*How did I die, Guang Qiu?* Jiaojiao asked.\n\n*...I believe it's called carbon monoxide poisoning, in your world.*\n\n*Of all the dumb...* Jiaojiao trailed off didn't speak for a long, long time. *Did anyone else die in the same incident that I did?*\n\n*Why does this matt--*\n\n*Just tell me!*\n\nGuang Qiu drew back at her vehemence *What!? How should I know? I grabbed the first soul I saw that could be used, I didn't stop to look around!*\n\nJiaojiao kept a hand at her neck, hand habitually grasping for something that wasn't there. She frowned, deep in thought. Where did that leave her? If Devika was dead, then why did she get to live? What made her so worthy? Was the world really this unfair?\n\n*Who's Devika?* Guang Qiu asked.\n\nJiaojiao glared. *I thought you couldn't hear my thoughts.*\n\n*You were thinking too loudly,* Guang Qiu said disdainfully. *Don't presume to think I would eavesdrop. Why would I stoop so low just to have a peek at a mere mortal's thoughts?*\n\n*She's my roommate,* Jiaojiao explained shortly. *If what you said is right, then she's probably dead too.*\n\nCarbon monoxide was colorless, tasteless, and the only symptoms that would generally manifest were dizziness, headaches and an upset stomach. No wonder she hadn't seen it coming. She'd merely blown it off as a flu. \n\n*Mortals. So fragile,* Guang Qiu said in liu of sympathy. *Don't take it so hard, she would have been dead in a mere fifty to sixty years anyway.*\n\n*As if fifty years is a trivial sampling of time!*\n\n*It is for me,* Guang Qiu said loftily.\n\nJiaojiao shook her head. She was asking too much if she thought this dumb ball could be understanding.\n\n*I have something I want, but I don't know if you can give it to me,* Jiaojiao said finally.\n\n*What?* The ball vibrated in impatience.\n\n*If you can bring me back to life, then you can bring others back to life too, correct?*\n\n*Absolutely not!* The ball cried, it's shape fuzzy and spiked with agitation. *You think this is a game? I won't do it, you can just give up that fanciful dream this instant!*\n\n*What's the matter?* Jiaojiao crossed her arms. *You resurrected me just fine. What's stopping you from doing it again for someone else?*\n\n*I wouldn't have bothered to do so if I were not compelled by extenuating circumstances! You think the cycle of reincarnation can just to flouted at a mortal's whim?*\n\n*Then I guess we have nothing to talk about,* Jiaojiao said. Her eyes were dark as she left the irate Guang Qiu to hobble into the darkened courtyard.","lastmodified":"2022-04-15T11:37:36.43780101Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/Chapter07-The-Stuttering-Concubine":{"title":"Chapter 07-The Stuttering Concubine","content":"A girl and a glowing ball stood over the prone form of an old woman in a deserted courtyard. The two stared down at the bound figure in silence, neither willing to be the first to speak after their apparent fall-out.\n\n*What do you intend to do with her?* The glowing ball asked finally. \n\n*What can be done?* Jiaojiao answered in a clipped manner. *I'm not going to kill her, don't ask me to do it again.*\n\n*We can't just leave her here,* the ball protested. *She's going to wake up eventually. What will you do then? What if she attacks you? Then what? With your current body you won't last two slaps from her. Even though this old thing is the bottom of the barrel in terms of strength, you are more feeble than a chicken.*\n\n*Don't put the faults of the body on me. It was in this state when I got here.*\n\n*And your original body was any better?* The ball sneered. \n\n*It could at least walk ten steps without getting dizzy.*\n\n*We seem to have gone off-topic,* the ball said. *What will you do when she wakes up?*\n\n*Well, if you want to see that damned bracelet again, I'm going to have to ask her what she's done with it.*\n\nThe ball fell silent, strangled.\n\n*If I'd gone ahead and killed her like you wanted where would I even know to look? Truly stupid.*\n\n*Mortal! You will show me the respect I'm due!*\n\nJiaojiao shook her head, then limped into the store room again, nearly tripping over a broken hoe. A bygone tool for a bygone time when the courtyard still had a viable garden she supposed. Further rummaging revealed more moldy twine and some rags that might have once been linens. Jiaojiao held them at arms length, dropping them in a pile next to Cen Wei. \n\nJiaojiao located a pair of rusty scissors in Cen Wei's quarters and snipped the piles of cloth into lengths that could be used to further bind the old woman. She made a game of cocooning the unconscious Cen Wei in swathes of smelly rags, grunting as she rolled the woman this way and that, taking petty revenge for all the times she'd felt belittled as she was manhandled by the old woman in the past day.\n\n*I think that's enough* the ball interrupted. *She is but a martial apprentice. This should be more than enough to hold her.*\n\nJiaojiao nodded, wiped the sweat from her brow with her sleeve, then dusted off her hands. She grabbed the bucket full of dirty dish water with difficulty and lugged it to the prone Cen Wei, dragging a trembling leg behind her. All the activity had set it afire with pain, but Jiaojiao grit her teeth and bore it. With more precarious maneuvering, she took a bowl and used it to splash dirty water onto the old woman's face.\n\nThe woman groaned, but did not wake. Another splash of water yielded similar results.\n\n*I think I might have hit her too hard.*\n\n*Well done,* the ball said sarcastically. *If you've killed her after all then what? After all that talk of not killing, you might have done the old woman in anyway. Splendid!*\n\nJiaojiao frowned and lifted one of the old woman's eyelids. Her pupils were blown out, and slightly uneven in size. She let the eyelid snap shut, and pushed down a very very slight pang of guilt.\n\n*Well, I'm no expert, but she seems concussed. I think she'll be fine. From what I understand, it's rare for you cultivators to die of something so small. Didn't people in the book bounce back from much worse?*\n\n*You're not wrong,* the ball said after a long moment. *I did a small scan. She will most likely be awake by noon tomorrow.*\n\nWhat was this scanning business? Jiaojiao wondered to herself. \n\n\"Ex-excuse me.\"\n\nJiaojiao turned to see a face peering at her and the fallen Cen Wei from the hole in the courtyard wall. The same face she'd spotted earlier in the day.\n\n\"She fell,\" Jiaojiao said.\n\nThe face didn't seem too know how to respond to this. \"Th-then, you-- I--\"\n\n*Excellent excuse,* the ball said. *I think she believes you.*\n\n\"What do you want?\" Jiaojiao asked.\n\n\"I-I was just...\" the face sputtered. \"I-- I know she's not a g-good woman. I saw y-you hit her, b-but don't w-worry, I w-won't tell anyone.\"\n\nJiaojiao limped closer to the wall. The face seemed taken aback, and almost seemed ready to make a run for it at her approach. \n\nIt was a beautiful face, delicate and smooth, with sparkling eyes, thought they were currently darting back and forth nervously. The young woman had red lips and even teeth. She was a great beauty, and Jiaojiao could not help staring, trying to rank the young woman on her personal list of outstanding faces. It was even more impressive given that plastic surgery was non-existent in this world.\n\n\"Top twenty for sure.\"\n\n\"W-what?\" The woman blinked at her. \n\n\"It's nothing.\"\n\n*Who is she?* Jiaojiao asked Guang Qiu.\n\n*...I don't know,* the ball responded after a long moment. *I don't think she is mentioned in the book at all.*\n\n\"Wh-what are y-you going to d-do now?\" the woman asked, anxiously holding an embroidered sleeve to her mouth. \"That old s-servant has been b-bought off by Head W-wife Zh-zhang. Sh-she won't b-be h-happy...\"\n\n*You need to stop speaking with her,* the ball cautioned. *You aren't supposed to meet this person at all.*\n\nWell, now she *had* to speak to this woman!\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\n\"I-I'm,\" the woman jolted back as if shocked. \"I'm a con-concubine of Family Head B-bai. I m-moved in-into this c-c-courtyard l-last month.\"\n\nWhat a way to refer to your own husband. Jiaojiao had almost forgotten that this was an era with very unbalanced gender roles. A man could own as many women as he could afford while a woman... heh. Plumbing didn't exist, but the patriarchy was alive and well!\n\n\"Bai Qinghan?\" Jiaojiao fished the name from the text in her head.\n\nThe woman's eyes widened. \"Y-you can't sp-speak your f-father's n-name like that! It's im-improper!\"\n\nJiaojiao almost rolled her eyes, but didn't want to further scandalize the stuttering beauty. What if she bit herself?\n\n\"Why did you call out to me?\" Jiaojiao asked instead.\n\n\"I was w-worried about y-you.\"\n\nJiaojiao wasn't sure she believed her. If she'd moved into the courtyard a month ago, then she must have seen her fair share of Bai Xingyue's suffering. \"Why now?\"\n\n\"You- you've k-kicked a h-hornet's nest now, b-by acting against the old w-woman. Head Wi-wife Zhang won't l-let this go. Y-you are in d-danger.\"\n\nHead Wife Zhang. What was she, some kind of end boss? \"I was always in danger.\"\n\n\"Y-you've never f-fought b-back before today. It's d-different. Y-you're,\" the woman gave her a meaningful gaze, \"you're d-different.\"\n\n\"I didn't have a choice. She was poisoning me and refused to get a doctor to look at my leg.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" the woman ducked her head. \"Th-that's awful of h-her. I a-always thought sh-she was a t-terrible person. Th-the way she tre-treated you.\"\n\n*Did you hear me!?* Guang Qiu roared. *Stop talking! Don't interact with irrelevant people!*\n\n\"I actually do need help,\" Jiaojiao said. \"Can you find a way to get a doctor to me?\"\n\n\"I--\" the woman looked down. \"I-I'm s-ss-sorry, but I c-can't do that.\"\n\nTsk.\n\n\"B-but, I have a way to g-get you o-out of the e-estate.\"\n\nJiaojiao smiled. \n\n\"B-but I d-don't think y-you should do it,\" the woman's eyes blinked rapidly. \"It's not a s-safe place out there for a y-young lady.\"\n\nJiaojiao gestured at her face. \"If you're worried about people taking advantage of me, as you can see...\"\n\nThe woman blushed charmingly, blood red and beguiling. \"I-I'm--you--\" she looked anywhere but at Jiaojiao's face. \"Being b-beauti-f-f-ful isn't e-every-thing.\"\n\nJiaojiao dissected her words, wondering why the woman was blushing for a dumbfounded moment. Was it because Jiaojiao spoke of being assaulted? Because she was embarrassed on Jiaojiao's behalf for her ugliness? And how dare she say that? Beauty was everything!\n\nJiaojiao built a career from beauty, and felt a bone-deep irritation at hearing this statement. Maybe the woman could feel how hypocritical she was being, speaking to her with that face?\n\nWell, whatever, it wasn't really any of her business. This was after all, *not her face.*\n\n\"Cen Wei pawned something really important of mine today,\" Jiaojiao said after an awkward silence. \"Do you have any idea where she might have taken it?\"\n\n\"Oh, well, \" the woman played with a strand of her hair, brow furrowed delicately. \"I'm not sure, but I think my first guess would be to try Yixin street. It has the most pawn shops. If you ask one by one, you are bound to find it sooner or later?\"\n\n*Good job, mortal! The end is in sight!* Guang Qiu cried, pulling an abrupt one-eighty.\n\n*Yeah? What happened to \"don't talk to irrelevant people\" huh?*\n\nGuang Qiu didn't dignify her with an answer. \n\n\"How long is this street? How many pawn shops are we talking?\"\n\n\"Well, it can't be more than fifty shops, surely?\"\n\n\"*Fifty shops?*\"  Jiaojiao echoed incredulously. \"Is the city nothing but pawn shops?\"\n\nThe woman laughed, a delightful clarity to her voice. \"Have you never been into the city? There's--\" then her eyes darted to the mark on her face and her laughter died. \"I'm s-sorry, I sh-shouldn't laugh. The c-city is very l-large. Yi-yixin street is nothing b-but a t-tiny c-corner of it.\"\n\n\"Great, splendid,\" Jiaojiao grumbled. \"I suppose I'm expected to get there on foot?\"\n\n*Mortal, you cannot balk now. The artifact is of the utmost importance.*\n\n\"You c-could always hire a r-rickshaw,\" the woman said with a sympathetic glance at her leg. \"You c-can p-probably sneak away f-for a d-day with no-no one noticing. Unless of c-course the th-third miss comes l-looking for you.\"\n\nJiaojiao shook her head. A little girl with a misplaced crush was the least of her concerns right now. \n\n\"How will you get me out?\"\n\n\"Come to my courtyard tomorrow morning. This section of the estate is not in good repair... anyway, you will see.\"\n\nAfter that, the face in the wall disappeared from sight. The sun was setting, throwing gloomy shadows over the lonely courtyard. The dried leaves rustled in the corners of the walls when a stray wind teased them, sending a rasping whispers echoing along the empty space. Cold blew in with the dusk, Jiaojiao drew her shoulders up to her ears, an insistent ache troubled her bad leg with the drop in temperature.\n\nShe took a disinterested glance at the prone form, stewing in dirty dish water in the middle of the courtyard. Sympathy was hard worn when she remembered how her own body had spent the last night in sopping wet clothes. Those two \"meals\" that old woman had fed her didn't help her case either.\n\n\"Good night, old woman,\" Jiaojiao said, draping her moldy blanket over Cen Wei before entering the servant's quarters and throwing the door shut behind her.\n\n*You're going to just leave her out there?*\n\n\"I can't move her with this leg, you want to give it a try? Besides, didn't you want her dead? She's lucky I gave her a covering at all,\" Jiaojiao said testily. As the dark encroached, Jiaojiao fumbled for an old pottery lantern, sporting hairline cracks. It was nothing more that a dish with congealed animal fat, a half-burnt cloth wick sticking out the side. \n\n\"How do I light this?\" Jiaojiao asked Guang Qiu.\n\n*Stupid mortal, use the huo zhe zi!*\n\nAfter some condescending instructions, Jiaojiao managed to use the antiquated old tube to produce a flame and touch it to the lamp wick. Jiaojiao squinted in the flickering light, displeased at the inadequate light levels and the smell of rancid fat sizzling away. She sorely missed modern lamps.\n\n\"How do people live like this?\"\n\n*Stop whining, it's just a little dark.*\n\n\"A little dark?\" Jiaojiao shook her head, rummaging in Cen Wei's things for a needle and thread. \"People would go blind working in these conditions. The eye strain is unbelievable.\"\n\n*Are you planning on staying here for the night?*\n\n\"It's not like the original occupant is using it. Besides, it's far cleaner than that mess in the other residence-- don't even start, I know what you're about to say, but why do I have to live in that miserable shack? Even Bai Jing didn't sleep there.\"\n\n*Heh, you have the gall to speak of Bai Jing?* Guang Qiu hovered over Jiaojiao, it's smoky form gloomy like a thundercloud. *Bai Jing would have bound the bracelet right now and contracted the White Tiger guardian. She would have entered the space and spent the night there!*\n\n\"*Not Bai Jing*,\" Jiaojiao sang.\n\n*If you had done something instead of letting f the bracelet slip through your fingers--*\n\nJiaojiao turned a deaf ear, busy inspecting the primitive sewing kit laid out before her. It came nestled in a plain wooden box, but all the necessary tools were there, including a set of metal needles and some plain off-white cotton thread. They weren't comparable to modern tools, but they would have to do.\n\n*--never in all my years have I seen such incompetence! I... what are you doing now?*\n\n\"Huh? Isn't it obvious?\" Jiaojiao smirked, expertly threading a needle. \"I'm doing what I do best.\"","lastmodified":"2022-04-15T11:37:36.43780101Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/Chapter08-Morning-and-Hu-Maoxun":{"title":"Chapter 08-Morning and Hu Maoxun","content":"Jiaojiao's eyelids creaked open, groaning as the dawn light slashed at her retinas like a scalpel. Distant birdsong filtered through the thin paper window, radiating cold. She moved her arms then hissed as her numb limbs responded with a prickling stab. She was half-bundled in Cen Wei's bed, slumped over a crumpled hanfu she'd spent half the night altering. The other half she'd slept fitfully, her head full of vague shadows and sad smiles. Her dozing mind took in the scene in front of her.\n\nFor a panicked moment, in between sleeping and waking, she thought she'd been kidnapped and thrown into a dingy location for safe-keeping. Then she remembered.\n\nGoddammit. She'd transmigrated.\n\nWait, was anything she'd just thought incorrect in essence? She shook out her dead arms, shooting a glare toward Guang Qiu, only to realize it was nowhere to be seen.\n\n\"Guang Qiu?\"\n\n*What?* came the instant, sullen reply. *Why are you making that face, mortal?*\n\nJiaojiao's crestfallen expression apparently irked the being, but she could not help hoping it had run out of battery or something. The fact that it had just been there, all night, waiting as she slept would never not be creepy.\n\n\"What do you do when I'm not awake?\" Jiaojiao asked. \"Did you just float there all night? Or did you sleep too?\"\n\n*I am beyond such needs. Don't mistake me for some feeble mortal.*\n\nHuh.\n\n*So don't get any funny ideas, mortal! I'll always be watching you!*\n\n\"Alright, simmer down, Sting.\" Jiaojiao stripped off her threadbare clothes, smirking as she sent the prudish Guang Qiu screaming out of the room. There had been a moment, as she worked, where she was astounded by how even her stitches were, given that they'd only been so-so in her past life. She chalked it up to the body's muscle memory, the previous occupant after all, probably did her share of mending clothes. Nevertheless, she was proud of what she'd accomplished in one night given that she had no access to a modern sewing machine, and she had done it by the light of an archaic lantern. \n\nHence the current ache in her eyeballs.\n\n\"Worth it,\" she told no one, as she dressed in the well-tailored gray robes, altered from the least distressed set found in Cen Wei's chest. It fit her scrawny figure perfectly, and while nothing could really flatter a stick-figure, she at least didn't look like a child playing dress-up. She'd even created a form-fitting mask from the scraps, maybe out of habit after going through the plague in modern times. Normally she'd balk at the thought of wearing used clothing, but literal beggars couldn't be choosers.\n\n*You spent all that time just for this? You* still *look like an impoverished peasant.* Guang Qiu ridiculed as he got a look at Jiaojiao's getup. \n\nAs a self-titled fashionista, Jiaojiao wouldn't be caught dead in sagging, loose-fitting robes. Well, dead again, since she had already died. At least she had been well dressed last time around since she made a point of looking sharp for her audience during streams. She would have died again in shame in the afterlife if she'd been found in her slouchy pajamas. She-- \n\nJiaojiao fell back onto the kang, shocked into silence.\n\n*Mortal! Are you all right?!* Guang Qiu flew over, radiating panic.\n\n\"I just realized, Guang Qiu.\"\n\n*What? What is it?*\n\n\"I hadn't finished my nails when I died,\" she turned to the ball, eyes hollow. \"What if they buried me with half-done nails?\"\n\nSilence.\n\n\"And what if they dress me in something awful? I don't trust my mother's fashion sense at all! What if--\"\n\n*Idiot!*\n\n\"It's not idiotic to want a dignified corpse!\" Jiaojiao gave the orb a scathing look. \"Not that you would understand, not having a body.\"\n\n*Is that something to be envied?* the ball sneered. *Even the best looking corpse becomes worm-food sooner or later.*\n\nJiaojiao was once again shocked into silence. She imagined that beautiful, perfect body of hers being boxed. Being lowered into the ground. Shriveling up and pickling in its own juices for years and years, decay stymied by embalming fluid. To the eventual collapse as rotting flesh split and cracked, unable to hold its integrity under the onslaught of time and a growing host of microorganisms.\n\n\"You bastard,\" Jiaojiao whispered, the ball's indignant rant about its need for respect drowned out by the ringing in her ears. It took five minutes for a brain to become unviable for resuscitation. How long had it been? Surely the body would have been found by now, along with whoever else had been unlucky enough to be caught in the gas leak. \n\nShe and Devika lived in a converted warehouse, so just the two of them probably.\n\n(This section better off in earlier chapters, don't mind me. Idiot author talking to self.)\n\nJiaojiao moved as if in a dream, the sights of her rotting corpse etched in her brain. She took a long detached glance at Cen Wei, lips blue and groaning and stuffed a ball of rags in her mouth. She secured the impromptu gag by fastening it behind the woman's head.\n\n*Why?*\n\n*She's waking up. What if she yells and alerts someone?*\n\nJiaojiao held her grumbling stomach. She adept at counting calories and would laugh if what she ate yesterday reached even a hundred units. Even so, her body didn't react to this much, being used to this level of near starvation, but this level of discomfort was enough to send Jiaojiao into a whining fit.\n\n\"I'm hungry,\" she told Guang Qiu. \"What do I do?\"\n\n*Are you slow? Go cook some food!*\n\n\"How?\" Jiaojiao asked. \"I don't even know where Cen Wei got the water.\"\n\nThere was a fraught silence. *Are you joking?*\n\n\"I'm from another world? With running water and indoor plumbing? Can you blame me for being ignorant?\"\n\n*There should be a well nearby.*\n\n\"You mean I have to literally draw water? From the ground? With this body? Forget it.\"\n\n*Then starve!*\n\n\"I already am!\"\n\nThe two bickered back and forth as Jiaojiao located the stone bucket that Cen Wei had used as a stove the day before. Next to it was the basket of wormy vegetables and a bag of inferior rice. She eyed the offerings with disgust but she was too hungry to refuse. She could light the fire and worry about the rest later. The awful noxious charcoal lay in a hemp bag in the storehouse. Jiaojiao fished out several handfuls and threw it in the bucket.\n\n\"What now? Do I just start a fire with the fire-stick?\"\n\n*You need tinder, you imbecile.*\n\nJiaojiao threw over that another handful of straw, then lit it on fire with the fire piston. The straw caught quickly, but soon died out. The charcoal remained dead and unlit.\n\n\"What did I do wrong?\"\n\n*How should I know? I'm not a mortal? Do you think I bother with such trivial things?*\n\nI'm going to die of starvation. I'll be the first to die of starvation after transmigrating. She gave Guang Qiu an angry look. \"Where is the justice? Other transmigrators get magic powers, a wise grandpa mentor, harems or artifacts but all I get is a broken leg and an ugly face.\"\n\n*You had an artifact! And you were the one who lost it!*\n\nBreakfast a lost cause, Jiaojiao donned a straw hat and grabbed a wooden pole she'd found in the storehouse as a cane. She wandered through the moon door leading out of the courtyard, hoping to cadge a meal from the stuttering concubine.\n\nShe made her way in the direction of the neighboring courtyard, but stopped short and shrunk back when she saw a young man in fine blue robes speaking with the woman from yesterday. He handed her a drawstring purse, then saluted before taking his leave, passing towards Jiaojiao's position. She hastily hid behind the edge of the moon door, breathing strangled when the footsteps paused right outside.\n\nThankfully, the young man didn't seem interested in investigating and left shortly after.\n\nJiaojiao waited for another three minutes before she felt safe leaving the confines of Bai Xingyue's courtyard, sneakily hobbling over to her destination. She didn't relish the thought of running into nosy servants or other residents of the estate and answering questions about why the resident disfigured shut-in was out and about.\n\n\"G-good, you m-made it,\" the stuttering concubine said, ushering her into her residence. Jiaojiao swallowed her questions about the young man. It really wasn't any of her business.\n\nJiaojiao took a curious look at the courtyard. It was identical to Bai Xingyue's in size in layout, but in far better repair. Even so, the age and overall neglect could not be dismissed. \n\nIt seemed that this section of the estate is reserved for those the Bai Family would prefer out of sight. No doubt the stuttering concubine was one such existence. Too pretty to throw away, but her speech impediment left her too embarrassing to be seen.\n\nJiaojiao's stomach gave a plaintive lurch as she laid eyes on the basket of steamed buns lounging on the low table in the reception room. The concubine caught her staring and tactfully gestured toward the table. \"Please, sit down and eat.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" Jiaojiao said, seating herself as gracefully as her damned leg would allow.\n\nThe two of them had breakfast in awkward silence.\n\n\"I didn't catch your name yesterday,\" Jiaojiao said, when she'd padded her stomach enough for it to stop screaming at her. \n\n\"I am Hu Maoxun,\" the young woman said, looking down with a blush.\n\n\"I suppose I don't need introduction, if you've been watching me for as long as you've lived here.\"\n\nThe woman had the decency to blush. \"I- it get's lonely here.\"\n\n\"It's fine, I'm not angry with you.\" Why would she be? It hadn't been her privacy being invaded for entertainment. \n\n\"Perhaps we should get going,\" the woman said. \"You don't have a lot of time.\"\n\nThey withdrew to the inner chamber where Hu Maoxun sat Jiaojiao down in front of an old vanity. \n\n\"You c-cannot go out as y-you are,\" her eye shifted over the mark on Jiaojiao's face. \"Your b-birthmark is far too r-recognizable.\"\n\nIndeed, the second young miss of the Bai Family was known far and wide as a horrifically ugly monster. An ongoing joke for being affianced to the crown prince.\n\nJiaojiao's eyes sparkled as Hu Maoxun placed a lacquer box on the vanity in front of her and opened the lid. Porcelein containers lay within with different shades of powder and rouge. \n\nJiaojiao looked from the containers of powder, each with paper seals untouched, then looked at Hu Maoxun's face. \n\nFine, it could be said that some people are simply blessed and do not need makeup to look good.\n\nHu Maoxun took the brush and started to apply the powder to Jiaojiao's face but Jiaojiao interrupted. \n\n\"Let me do it.\" Are you kidding? *Do you know who I am?*\n\nJiaojiao dipped the brush into the powder with an expert hand and began blending and dabbing her face, switching brushes with a dexterity that spoke of long familiarity. Hu Maoxun watched from the side, half in puzzlement and half in wonder as the girl's face went from horrifically disfigured to... well at least she was no longer disfigured.\n\nJiaojiao placed down the brush with a dissatisfied frown, turning her head to look back and forth. It would have to do, she supposed. The quality of the cosmetics were far from her usual standard. What she wouldn't give for liquid foundation and a beauty blender.\n\nThe two exited the residence and Hu Maoxun led her to a boarded up section of the wall. \n\n\"This leads to the outside,\" she said with some embarrassment, moving the board aside with a blush. \"You will have to crawl to get to the other side.\"\n\nJiaojiao looked at the hole. The wall was about six or seven inches thick, the other side covered with a shrub or bush.\n\nShe hefted her make-shift cane, forced a smile and gave Hu Maoxun a formal salute. \"I can't thank you enough for your help.\"\n\n\"It's n-nothing. I grow b-bored by myself. This was an a-amusing m-morning,\" Hu Maoxun suddenly pressed a cloth pouch into her hands. \"Please take this.\"\n\nJiaojiao looked down at it, recognizing it as the same pouch that young man had given Hu Maoxun that same morning. From the feel of it, it was filled with ingots. All this for an \"amusing\" morning? This little was considered amusing for the poor woman?\n\nJiaojiao took a proper look at the shy beauty, not know what to say. They didn't know each other at all, but Hu Maoxun was the first kind person she had encountered since waking up in this body.\n\n\"D-don't r-refuse, you will n-need the m-money if you w-want to fix your l-leg and retrieve the thing your s-servant pawned. I don't h-have much use for money...\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" Jiaojiao said simply, bowing again, this time more sincerely. \"I won't forget this.\"","lastmodified":"2022-04-15T11:37:36.43780101Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/Chapter09-The-Rickshaw-and-the-Clinic":{"title":"Chapter 09-The Rickshaw and the Clinic","content":"Jiaojiao, sweaty, irritated, and very unhappy, arrived at a deserted road half a mile from the outer wall of the Bai Estate. She cursed the Bai Family ancestors for choosing to establish their compound so far from a main road. There was no one in sight and she was already tired, her right leg a dead, agonized weight attached to her hip. Even Guang Qiu had fallen silent, content to watch her suffer. Or perhaps it had the decency to keeps its mouth shut.\n\n\"That's it, I can't go on,\" Jiaojiao announced, abruptly sitting down at the side of the road, uncaring of the dust and gravel underfoot.\n\n*You must,* Guang Qiu roared. *What of the artifact? Every second we delay some idiot mortal swoop in and take it!*\n\n\"Why are you so worried?\" Jiaojiao wiped the sweat from her neck with a sleeve, then held it at arms length, disgusted with her own actions, disgusted with the world in general. \"It's not as if anyone knows it's true value. It's just a wooden bracelet to all eyes but yours.\"\n\n*We cannot take the risk. If it slips through our grasp, what then?*\n\n\"Then I guess the universe doesn't want us to have the bracelet,\" Jiaojiao tapped her lap impatiently. \"What do you want me to do? I can't even move this leg right now.\"\n\nAs if on cue, a teenaged boy pulling a rickshaw behind him clattered around the bend in the road, head down as sweat streamed down his face. He was dressed in worn hemp clothes, even rougher than the ones Jiaojiao was wearing. She watched as the boy drew nearer and nearer, expelling a put upon sigh. Must she be forced to move?\n\n\"Wait,\" she called as the boy drew within earshot. \"I want to hire you!\"\n\nThe boy jerked his face up, surprised to see a person half-lying by the side of the road, no doubt. Face unsure, he stopped next to Jiaojiao. \"Where are you going?\"\n\n\"Do you know where I can find a reputable doctor?\"\n\n*Mortal!* Guang Qiu shrieked in her mind.\n\n\"I can take you to one,\" the boy said.\n\n\"How much?\"\n\nThe boy scanned Jiaojiao's form with a critical eye, taking in her altered servant's robes, dusty and damp with sweat, her straw hat, old and splintered. Her spirit over-taxed and woe-begone.\n\n\"Five coppers.\"\n\nJiaojiao wasn't an idiot. She could tell the boy had bumped up the price, but she was too lazy to argue and she was *tired*.\n\n\"Fine, fine,\" she stood with effort and fished a few copper coins from her sleeve. \"Half now, half upon arrival.\"\n\nThe boy grunted by way of agreement and pulled the cart back onto the road when Jiaojiao had seated herself. With a hop he took off running, his speed little affected by Jiaojiao's addition weight. Jiaojiao had no choice to be impressed by his physical fitness.\n\n*Mortal, what are you doing? Didn't we agree we would retrieve the artifact first?*\n\n*When did we reach this fictatious agreement?* Jiaojiao closed her eyes. The morning breeze wicking the sweat from her brow felt *heavenly*.\n\nGuang Qiu sputtered. *You--you--*\n\n*You know, Guang Qiu, I've only been in this world for a day, but I've had a lot of time to think about why I'm here.*\n\n*You will listen to me--*\n\nJiaojiao inspected her ragged nails. *I've come to a conclusion. Despite all your threats, I don't think you can do a thing to me.\n\n*Don't be so sure, mortal--*\n\nJiaojiao smiled to herself. She didn't have all the answers, but she had enough. From the scraps of information Guang Qiu dropped, she could ascertain that she possessed something that led Guang Qiu to choose her out of all of the dead souls on earth. If she was so easily replaced, she didn't doubt Guang Qiu would have switched her with the first gullible rando he could find. After all, why bother fishing back a soul from earth at all? Wouldn't it make more sense to grab a local that was familiar with this world? After all, it was painfully evident, *she* didn't know what the hell she was doing. She couldn't even feed herself!\n\nFurthermore, if what if it was specifically a soul from earth that was needed? Going by what Guang Qiu said, she had a long long time before the passage between worlds opened again and they found a replacement for her. What could happen in one thousand years? Two thousand years? Assuming she even lived that long. \n\nJiaojiao didn't care much for the idea of immortality. Especially immortality in a world with none of the modern necessities she so craved.\n\n\"Things are precious because they have an end,\" she sighed.\n\n\"What?\" the boy panted from the head of rickshaw. \"Did you say something?\"\n\n\"It's nothing,\" Jiaojiao replied, shaking her head. She took another admiring glance at the boy, huffing and puffing under weight of the rickshaw.\n\n*Why couldn't you have gotten me a body like his?* she asked Guang Qiu, who had gone as quiet as a strangled chicken. She immediately regretted engaging it as this seemed to light a fire under its metaphorical ass.\n\n*You dare speak to me thus?*  it thundered in her ear, buzzing and humming like an irate cellphone. *You will show me respect! If it were not for me, you would be dead! You should be grateful you have a body at all! I--*\n\n*Yes, yes, yes,* Jiaojiao interrupted. *You've made your point. Don't worry, the moment I finish seeing the doctor, I will go to Yixin street.*\n\n*Hah! Fool me once! As if I will believe your lies!*\n\n*Actually, I never lied.*\n\n*I will believe you if you make a vow!*\n\n*Why should I care if you believe me or not?*\n\n*I--I--*\n\nJiaojiao smiled.\n\n*I won't let you rest if you don't! Guang Qiu said triumphantly. *I will nag and nag until you do!*\n\nJiaojiao's face fell. \n\n*Hah, that will teach you to defy me-- see if I let you rest at all, if you don't listen to me. Just watch me! I don't need to rest, I can go all night! I will scream in your ear until dawn--*\n\nJiaojiao pinched the bridge of your nose. *That... sounds so wrong. Please stop.*\n\n*Well, mortal?*\n\nThere was a very good reason Jiaojiao was hesitant to make vows. In this blasted world she'd landed in, a person's vows had a real binding effect. Even if she was still a skeptic where magic was concerned, she didn't want to take the risk.\n\n*I vow to go to Yixin street after I see the doctor,*  Jiaojiao said finally with a scoff. *Happy?*\n\n*I would be* happy *if Bai Jing--*\n\n*My god, you little fan boy, just stop!*\n\nJiaojiao's enjoyment of the scenery was almost ruined by Guang Qiu's ongoing argument, but inner voice cut off as the rickshaw turned down a busy street. \n\nThe orderly streets spread open in front of her, hammering in the point that she was really in another world. Or at least, a very expensive movie set. She took in the bustling forms, the farmers hawking their wares, the armored guards standing on the corners of each street, the skeins of silk hanging in neat bunches outside of a dye shop. Chaotic voices called to one another through the crowds. A young child darted underfoot, a rattle drum grasped in one hand, their mother yelling after them to watch out for the carts.\n\n\"We're here,\" the boy said, lowering the poles with a grunt. \"It's that shop over there.\"\n\nJiaojiao placed the other half of the payment in his outstretched hand. \"If you have time, I have another job for you later, after I see the doctor.\"\n\nHe took the money and nodded, seemingly not much for words.\n\nJiaojiao hopped off the rickshaw, subtly patting her numb ass. The ancient roads left something to be desired and it wasn't as if the primitive rickshaw had shock absorbers. \n\nShe let herself through the open doors of the clinic, wrinkling her nose as the pungent smell of herbs assaulted her senses. She could practically taste the gingko on her tongue.\n\nThe shop was well-kept, with clean floors and counters, but there there was a noticeable stillness. The waiting area was empty and many of the drawers on the wall had been pulled out and stacked on the counter. A glance revealed nothing inside. Furthermore, there was no one in sight. \n\nJiaojiao hefted her staff and rapped the counter. \"Hello?\"\n\nA middle-aged man with a short beard and impatient frown stalked into view, his white robes cutting a stark figure. \"Don't scratch my counters, girl!\"\n\n*Okay then.* Jiaojiao lowered her staff. \"I'm here for a consultation.\"\n\nThe man raked a scathing glance over her dusty body. \"Do you have money?\"\n\n\"I have money.\"\n\nThe man held out his hand with a flourish of his long, flowing sleeves. \"Fifty silver ingots.\"\n\nJiaojiao stared at it. Did this man take her for a simpleton? Even if fifty silver ingots was a reasonable price, she didn't have fifty silver ingots to feed this gluttonous troll.\n\n\"Well?\" the man gestured impatiently. \"I don't have all day.\"\n\nJiaojiao smiled. \"That's funny. Neither do I.\"\n\n\"Did you come in here to play games? Give me the money or get out.\"\n\n\"Are you a beggar?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nJiaojiao's smile grew brighter. \"I said, are you a beggar?\"\n\n\"Outrageous!\" the man barked, his fist raised. \"How dare you? I am a doctor!\"\n\n\"Then act like one. All I see is a greedy old man eager to part a young girl from her money.\" \n\n\"You asked for a consultation, I don't run a charity.\"\n\n\"Do you see my youth, and perhaps think I am easy to cheat? I'll pay you after, not before.\"\n\n\"I will not tolerate this disrespect!\"\n\n\"Do you even have the skills?\" Jiaojiao took a pointed glance at the deserted waiting area.\n\nThe frown turned into one of wrath. \"You dare question my skills?\"\n\n\"I'm only returning rudeness for rudeness,\" Jiaojiao said.\n\n\"I am a doctor!\" the man said again.\n\nJiaojiao shook her head and turned to leave. \n\n\"Wait!\"\n\nJiaojiao didn't stop.\n\nA hand closed over her shoulder. She turned to glare at the man. \"Don't touch me.\"\n\n\"I will take a look at your leg,\" the man forced out through gritted teeth. \"That is why you are here, yes?\"\n\n\"I see you aren't blind.\"\"\n\nThe man audibly ground his teeth. \"Just promise you'll pay me afterward.\"\n\n\"We'll see.\"\n\nThe man withdrew his hand, gesturing for Jiaojiao to follow him to the back with an irritated jerk of his arm .\n\n*Why did he change his mind?* Guang Qiu said.\n\n*He badly needs money. You can see how run down this place is. There's no customers, and half the shelves are empty. My guess is he's about to close down. In other words he's very near desperation.*\n\n*Wait...*\n\n*Yes, if my guess is correct,* Jiaojiao's face turned solemn. *This man is Doctor Tai.*","lastmodified":"2022-04-15T11:37:36.43780101Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/Chapter10-The-Broken-Body":{"title":"Chapter 10-The Broken Body","content":"Jiaojiao sat there, a healthy amount of skepticism making itself known by her unenthused expression as the doctor felt her pulse at her wrist. He had placed a handkerchief between their hands, because *propriety*. Jiaojiao couldn't spare the energy to ridicule this excessive need for distance between the sexes. By what she'd gathered from the text, the physicians in this world had the ability to diagnose patients just by feeling their pulse. Bai Jing herself was an expert at this technique, demonstrated over and over by her various encounters with ill people, always with some affliction that left lesser doctors scratching their heads. These people, usually of rich and affluent backgrounds, were always left impressed by such a young doctor, showering her with accolades and favors. Even Doctor Tai, the man currently diagnosing her and a famous doctor in his own right, (though he was currently going through a rough patch) had been left awestruck, going so far as to call her *shifu.*\n\n*Indeed, the plot has been bent out of shape,* Guang Qiu lamented in her mind. *This disciple has been lost.*\n\nJiaojiao's mind wandered as the doctor furrowed his brow, concentrating on her pulse. She kept a paranoid eye on the outer area, lost in thought. *The text is a bit vague on this, but if what it says here is true, he should be in the palace for another few days.*\n\n*What was that mortal?*\n\n*Nothing.*\n\nDoctor Tai's eyes finally opened, shooting her an odd, scrunched look.\n\n\"Well?\" she asked, when he continued to stare.\n\n\"You,\" he said slowly, \"How are you even alive?\"\n\n*That's a really good question.* Jiaojiao almost laughed out loud. *Guang Qiu, do you think this guy is a psychic?*\n\n*Nonsense, there's nothing special about this mortal. Even his medical skills are only so-so--* Guang Qiu said.\n\n\"You have two different poisons running through you,\" Doctor Tai said haltingly, as if parsing a very difficult math problem. \"Either one should be enough to kill you, but to have both--\" a sharp look, \"--just who are you?\"\n\n*Cough, I suppose his skills aren't bad for such a backward realm,* Guang Qiu amended. \n\n*There's two poisons?* Jiaojiao said incredulously. *Just how much does Head Wife Zhang hate this girl?*\n\nGuang Qiu tsked in a rare moment of accord. *She is indeed a poisonous shrew.*\n\n\"I see your face has traces of powder. Is there perhaps a red mark on your face? Are perhaps also a martial cripp--\"\n\n\"Is this relevant?\" Jiaojiao deflected the man's peaking professional interest. \"I just came here to get my leg looked at.\"\n\n\"I'm a doctor,\" the man repeated, as if Jiaojiao were likely to forget, \"I take my job very seriously. You can't just ask me to ignore an aspect of my patient's health.\"\n\n\"Well, this patient is asking you to ignore it.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Just who is it that has the money here?\" Jiaoajiao gripped her staff as if she were ready to stand. \"Shall I take my business elsewhere?\"\n\n\"Very well,\" Doctor Tai  bit out. \"Keep your secrets. Roll up your pants.\"\n\nJiaojiao did so with difficulty, her right leg numb and unresponsive from her morning journey. \n\nThe man paused, taking in the horrific mess of old scar tissue and knotted flesh with clinical eyes. He draped the handkerchief over the old crooked break in the calf and began to poke and prod.\n\n\"Looks like a compound fracture, both tibia and fibula snapped. A clean break, but left untreated and complicated with infection. I'm surprised the leg hasn't rotten off your body. How old is this? About five years?\"\n\n*How should I know?* Jiaojiao complained. The book hadn't included many details on how or when Bai Xingyue had broken her leg, only stating that that her dear father had done the breaking. \n\n\"Wouldn't it be easier to look at without the cloth?\" She asked instead of answering.\n\nThe man shot her an affronted look. \"I am a gentleman!\"\n\nJiaojiao gave up. She would never understand the exaggerated modesty of the ancients.\n\nAfter what seemed like an hour, the doctor stood, wiping his hands even though they'd never touched flesh. \"I can reset the leg, but I can't promise you that you'll be able to walk any straighter afterward.\"\n\nJiaojiao squinted. \"How much?\"\n\n\"Fifty--\"\n\n\"You want to try that again?\"\n\nHe glowered. \"Twenty.\"\n\n\"Ten.\"\n\n\"Fifteen!\"\n\n\"Twelve.\"\n\n\"Thirteen! My final offer!\"\n\n\"Done.\" Jiaojiao said.\n\nHaving reached a deal, the doctor instructed her to lay flat on the platform, then handed her a wooden dowel about three fingers thick and a foot long. She took it with a puzzled glance.\n\n\"So you don't bite yourself.\"\n\nWhat the hell? \"What about anesthesia.\"\n\n\"Unavailable.\"\n\nJiaojiao had never stood faster in her life, gimp leg or no. \"I think I'll find another doctor.\"\n\n\"Do you seriously thing you'd be able to find another willing to help you? Remember the poison you have running through your veins? They'll take one look and decide they won't want to mess with anyone who has enemies powerful enough to afford heartbreak ganoderma *and* meridian shattering grass,\"\n\nJiaojiao stopped, half sitting, half crouching. \"But it will hurt.\" She whined.\n\n*Stop whinging, mortal. You're wasting time.* Guang Qiu interjected.\n\n*Well, excuse me for my hesitation! What a coward I am, not wanting to have my leg broken without anesthesia!*\n\n\"Hurry up,\" the doctor urged, seemingly in concert with the unseen and unheard Guang Qiu. \"I don't have all day!\"\n\nJiaojiao bit back a sarcastic quip about the doctor's busy clinic. It wouldn't do to piss off the man about to break your leg. \n\nFinally, slowly, heart beating a nervous staccato in her chest, Jiaojiao lay back and placed the wooden rod between her lips. The doctor had reappeared with a wooden mallet. She squeezed her eyes shut.\n\nShe felt a firm grip holding down her right leg then, a huge force impacted her leg with a horrific crack, accompanied by a screaming of panicked nerves telling her, *yes indeed, your leg has been broken. Why did you agree to this, you* collassal *idiot?*\n\nJiaojiao squeezed her eyes shut tight, tears trickling into her temples as she bit down hard on the dowel. She twisted, groaning in pain.\n\n\"Hold still,\" the doctor said, voice almost bored. \"I'm setting the bone.\"\n\nJiaojiao felt a great pressure on her leg as the doctor pulled the leg straight. She had thought the worst of the pain was over but she was greatly mistaken. She could not help the unholy shriek that burst from her. The doctor set the bone, reinforcing it with two rods, cousins to the one currently creaking in distress between her jaws. He then bound it with strips of rough hemp cloth, pulling it taut against her leg.\n\nThen the dowel was taken from her lips. Jiaojiao opened her eyes in time to see a round brown object stuffed into her mouth. It was terribly bitter and broke into a mess of powder the moment it hit her tongue. A riot of conflicting flavors, all terrible, invaded her tastebuds. She nearly spat it out, but the doctor glared at her.\n\n\"Swallow it.\"\n\nJiaojiao choked down the herbal powder with difficulty. \"What was that?\"\n\n\"Medicine to heal your leg, or did you think the thirteen taels was the price of breaking a bone?\" The doctor laughed sarcastically. \"Even I'm not that shameless.\"\n\nSo you *are* self aware, Jiaojiao thought, then closed her eyes again, unable to have a meaningful discourse with her leg radiating monstrous pain. \n\n\"Your leg will be strong enough to walk on after a week of healing, but I'd advise against running, jumping or heavy lifting. Try not to exert too much stress on it. Keep off your feet as much as possible,\" a pause, \"not that it matters much. With that poison in you, I doubt you'll live more than a few months.\"\n\n*Great bedside manner, doc. Five stars.*\n\n\"You have half a shichen to recuperate. Then I'm kicking you out.\"\n\nRetreating footsteps, then the sound of a door slamming shut. \n\n*Mortal?*\n\n*Shut up Guang Qiu. The artifact can affort to wait until I'm not a writhing mess of pain.*\n\nThere was a dissatisfied silence, but the ball didn't speak again.\n\nJiaojiao drifted, half insensible with pain, for what seemed like days. It took all her willpower not to scream out and make a fool of herself, but the thought of the doctor's sarcastic smile gave her a dose of strength.  Thankfully, the doctor's medicine was not just a sugar pill, and the soon pain died down to manageable levels. Jiaojiao sat up, wiping the tears from her eyes. It was without question that the layer of powder had been half ruined by her pain-induced weeping. \n\nShe took a look around, but there was no reflective surface she could use to inspect herself. She placed the straw hat on her head again, hoping it would be enough to obscure her features. Gingerly, she lowered her left leg down off the platform, then much more carefully, her right. Jiaojiao leaned heavily on her staff and shuffled toward the door, nearly falling over several times. It was the best Jiaojiao could expect in this era before plaster casts and aluminum crutches.\n\nShe made it past the partition between the front and back sections of the clinic when she heard a deep, magnetic voice.  A terrible premonition came to her, stopping her in her tracks. Unable to bring herself to move forward, she began inching backward. \n\n*What do you think you're doing, mortal? Stop wasting time!*\n\nShit. Shit. Jiaojiao was repeating to herself in an endless litany. I hope that isn't who I think it is.\n\n\"You there! Girl! Are you done taking up space in my clinic?\" The doctor came after her shrinking form. \"If you're able to walk about then it's time for you to pay up and leave.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't happen to have a back entrance in this place, would you?\" Jiaojiao asked.\n\nThe doctor gave her a strange look. \"Yes... why do you ask? Nevermind, just give me the money and get out.\"\n\nJiaojiao slapped the silver taels into his hand and gave him an angry smile. \"Take me out the back.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n*Why are you still here? Just go! We don't have time for this!* Guang Qiu said.\n\nJiaojiao summoned all her dwindling patience. \"*Fine.*\" And began the arduous journey out the front of the clinic, hoping her premonition wasn't accurate. Please don't let it be *that guy.*\n\nHer pleas to the universe went unheeded. A tall figure with fine black embroidered robes stood in the dusty waiting area, a white porcelain mask over his face. He raised his head to look in her direction as she shuffled closer, radiating a cold and ferocious aura.\n\nJiaojiao stopped, frozen in dread. *Why the fuck is it him?* \n\n*Mortal! Mortal!* Guang Qiu said, sounding like Christmas had come early. *Look! It's him! Your future husband!*","lastmodified":"2022-04-15T11:37:36.43780101Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/Chapter11-The-Cold-Prince":{"title":"Untitled Page","content":"*Crap, shit, fuck, piz-detz, hui.*\n\nThe future husband Guang Qiu spoke of was named Mo Wudi, the titular character in *The Cold Prince Loves me Dearly*. Not only was he cold, he was an ice-cold killer. And not only was he an ice-cold killer, he was an ice-cold killer prone to sudden, inexplicably rages, notorious for lashing out at random.\n\nHe had two identities, one as the thirteenth prince of Languo, and the other, more mysterious identity as the masked head of the Abyss Syndicate, an organization that dominated the Jianghu.\n\nMore importantly, in addition to having great influence, Mo Wudi was one of the most physically jacked people in Languo, having crossed the threshold of martial master and stepped on the true threshold of immortal cultivation.\n\nIf Mo Wudi was considered a level 90 player, then Jiaojiao would be one of those harmless atmospheric mobs that would die with a casual poke. It was imperative that she avoid this mercurial psycho as much as possible. \n\n*What are you waiting for?* Guang Qiu said. *Go introduce yourself!*\n\nJiaojiao ignored the ball and shuffled as rapidly as she could with her immobilized right leg. She made a sharp angle toward the counter, intent on giving the living yama a wide berth. The figure turned with her movements, the glaring demon eyes of the mask fixed upon her.\n\n*Yeah, that's not creepy at all.*\n\n*Don't be shy, just go up and talk to him,* Guang Qiu coaxed, as if it were a wingman in a singles bar.\n\nUnfortunately, the clinic was not that spacious, and Jiaojiao was not that lucky. Her balance failed her at the worst juncture and she found herself falling toward that cold figure with almost calculated precision.\n\n*Gav-no!* Jiaojiao defaulted to Russian in her time of crisis.\n\nAs Jiaojiao fell, she had a split second to consider several possibilities. Taking Mo Wudi's personality as depicted in the webnovel, there were two likely outcomes. One, he would simply dodge aside and allow Jiaojiao to humiliate herself as nature intended. Or two, he would be too lazy to move and slap her dead with a contemptuous palm. \n\nHowever, neither of these scenarios came to pass. Instead of face-planting on the clinic floor or stepping onto the naihe bridge, she found herself cradled in an unlikely pair of firm arms. Her straw hat was bumped off her head and her face smushed against a solid chest.\n\nJiaojiao couldn't move, frozen in pure fright. One second, two seconds, then she jerked her face as if the young man was made from scalding hot coals. \n\n*Hashtag wtf?*  What was this shoujo manga development? Where was the crazy, murderous psychopath I was promised?\n\n\"Thank you very much,\" Jiaojiao said robotically as she shuffled back. \"I need to go now goodbye.\"\n\nShe booked it, making for the front entryway as fast as she could with her immobilized leg. Are you kidding? If she didn't leave now when would she? What if Mo Wudi realized he'd broken character and came after her to fix his gaffe?\n\n*Where are you going?* Guang Qiu said. *You didn't even say more than a few words. What a splendid first encounter! He hugged you!*\n\nThe only thing missing from Guang Qiu's speech was a squeal of delight. \n\n*We are leaving. Now.*\n\n*Why are you so eager to leave?*\n\n*Didn't you want to go get the artifact or was that not you whining the entire morning?*\n\n*You can ask him to go with you!*\n\n*Guang Qiu I don't know if I should be amused or disgusted by your naivete. What makes you think he'll agree? We are nothing by passersby.*\n\n\"Wait,\" said a deep magnetic voice.\n\n*He's talking to you!*\n\n*What? I didn't hear anything.* She was almost at the door--\n\n\"Girl, stop.\"\n\n*You must have heard that. Who else could he be talking to? Surely not Doctor Tai,* Guang Qiu said sarcastically.\n\n*Who are we to question Doctor Tai's gender identity?*\n\n\"Didn't you hear the young--, I mean this gentleman?\" Doctor Tai stepped forward to catch Jiaojiao by the sleeve. \"Where do you think you're going in a rush? One would think your leg isn't broken at all!\"\n\n\"What does this gentleman have to do with me? Should I stop to answer every random heckler?\" Jiaojiao smiled. \"Or are you intent on harassing a young lady?\"\n\nThe Doctor sneered. \"Don't put on airs now. You think I didn't see you just now, when you practically threw yourself in this man's arms?\"\n\n\"Are we living in the same reality? I only have one leg right now. Is it so strange that I tripped? The man caught me, I thanked him, and now would like to go on with my day. Who are you people to stop me?\" Jiaojiao jerked her sleeve from Doctor Tai's grasp, thumping her staff for emphasis.\n\n\"Bai Xingyue.\"\n\nJiaojiao froze.\n\nDoctor Tai's eyes widened, as if he was seeing Jiaojiao for the first time. \"No wonder you're half dead with poison.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's me,\" Jiaojiao said through gritted teeth. \"What of it?\"\n\nThe masked man, brushed off a smudge of powder from the front of his robe. \"Your makeup is shedding.\"\n\nShe nearly combusted from embarrassment. If this were her previous life on earth, being caught wearing inferior cosmetics would be a career ending snafu. \"Thank you for alerting me. Is that all?\"\n\n\"I didn't realize we had the future empress in our humble establishment!\" Doctor Tai was sneering. \"Dianxia, thus humble servant sends his greetings!\"\n\n\"Hahahaha,\" Jiaojiao had no more fucks to give and was seriously fed up. She left no parting remark, simply leaving the doctor and the impassive Mo Wudi to whatever conversation they were having before she'd interrupted.\n\nThe rickshaw puller was where she left him, she threw him another few copper coins. \"To Yixin street.\"\n\nJiaojiao had an interesting time dragging her splinted leg into the cart while the rickshaw driver offered no help, simply taking her struggles as scenery. As the rickshaw pulled into traffic, Jiaojiao pulled the straw hat lower on her face, shading it from the noonday sun. \n\n*I still think you should have asked him to go with you.*\n\n*Guang Qiu, why are you so sure he'd like me?* Jiaojiao asked, genuinely curious. *After all, I am not Bai Jing. I have very little in common with him. If I read the story correctly, he liked Bai Jing because she was similar to him. After all, they could bond over the art of murder or some such. What do I have in common with that guy? Huh?*\n\n*It doesn't matter! You can develop with time!*\n\n*Not likely. Do you know how old that guy is? He's seventeen!*\n\n*...and?*\n\n*You think a seventeen year old boy and a twenty-three year old girl are a likely pair?*\n\n*...but your body is only fifteen years old.*\n\n*Is this the point? You think just because the body is fifteen the mind will regress?* Jiaojiao shook her head. It would be like a high school student dating a college graduate. She doubted she could have a single meaningful conversation with a seventeen year old, much less a whole-ass relationship. Highschool boys were closer to apes than people in her view. *Besides, in my world, a seventeen year old getting with a twenty-three year old is considered statutory rape.*\n\n*This isn't your old world,* Guang Qiu argued. *To be unmarried at twenty-three... you would be called a spinster.*\n\nJiaojiao glared at the ball. *Call me that again.*\n\n*Don't get offended, it's true! Besides, isn't this a good opportunity to fix your status?*\n\n*Why do you think being single is something to be fixed? Maybe I'm happy being single.*\n\n*Isn't this what mortals do? Get married, have babies and then die. Besides, you must form a relationship with Mo Wudi. The plot calls for it!*\n\nJiaojiao shook her head. In the events of the webnovel, Bai Jing met and fell in love with Mo Wudi, despite a nine year age difference. Big Yikes. Put even if she could excuse that behavior as being in a gray area due to Bai Jing being in a younger body, their entire relationship dynamic made Jiaojiao uncomfortable to read. Mo Wudi was a deeply troubled young man and Bai Jing happened to fill a void in his life. It was disturbing to note that the teenager was deeply obsessed with the woman after meeting her, even abandoning many aspects of his life to please her. The novel portrayed it as a deep and moving love story, but Jiaojiao wasn't so sure.\n\n*That boy needs therapy, not a relationship. I don't have the energy or ability to fix him.*\n\nGuang Qiu grumbled but didn't push it. Perhaps occupied with the thought of retrieving the artifact. *Perhaps it's for the best you left when you did. You're not supposed to meet him for another few days anyway.*\n\nThe rest of the ride passed in silence. Jiaojiao watched the sights of the city pass by, wrinkling her nose as they passed a marketplace. The babble of servants bargaining with the sellers filled her ears. Rotten vegetable leaves choked the gutters and a tanned woman wrung the neck of a squawking chicken. Jiaojiao looked on, aghast.A gaggle of painted beauties loitered in front brightly decorated storefront, beckoning to passing men. A gust of wind brought the smell of incense and perfume. Enticing smells drifted from the roadside carts, sellers calling out prices, ladling dumplings into wooden bowls.\n\n\"We're here,\" the rickshaw driver paused on the corner of a quiet street. \n\nJiaojiao showed the rickshaw the token she'd found in Cen Wei's sleeve. \"Do you know which shop this is from?\"\n\nThe rickshaw driver simply pointed to a particular shop, a it had gaudily decorated front with red lanterns and gold paint, a contrast to the other more modestly attired shops on the street.\n\n\"Looks like a scam,\" Jiaojiao muttered as she hauled her body off the rickshaw. She slowly made her way through the crowd, careful not to jostle her leg. Thankfully the crowd wasn't too dense and she only suffered a few slight bumps. As she neared the shop entrance, a girl dressed in a bright pink exited the shop, speaking sharply to the two servants flanking her. \n\nJiaojiao nearly twisted into a pretzel turning aside, hurriedly pulling the straw hat down in front of her face.\n\n*Isn't that...*\n\n*Yep.*\n\nBai Xingwu, the violent girl who'd nearly punched into a paste the day before was somehow a patron of very the same shop Cen Wei frequently pawned things to. Who would have thought? Does this ugly shop have some destiny with the Bai Family?\n\n\"Mistress, you have such good taste!\" one of the servants said.\n\n\"This shimmering pearwood bracelet looks so pretty on your wrist! It really makes your skin glow!\"\n\n*No. No way.*\n\n*Mortal!* Guang Qiu wailed in her mind. *That girl has the artifact!*","lastmodified":"2022-04-15T11:37:36.43780101Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/Chapter12-The-Pawnshop":{"title":"Chapter 12-The Pawnshop","content":"\"Wait, young miss,\" a voice came from inside the pawnshop.\n\nJiaojiao found a shadowed alley to her left and made a slow retreat toward it as Bai Xingwu turned to confront the man calling after her.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" she asked haughtily, chin raised to the sky.\n\nA man wearing a festive red shop uniform came into view with a chagrined expression. \"There has been a mistake, that bracelet isn't for sale as the default period has not passed.\"\n\n\"What do you mean? I paid money for it. It's mine now.\"\n\nThe man bowed his head, \"I apologize, but it really isn't for sale.\"\n\n\"Do you know who I am?!\" Bai Xingwu stomped her foot.\n\nJiaojiao nearly laughed. *Next, she'll ask if they know who her father is.*\n\n\"Do you know who my father is?!\"\n\nThis time Jiaojiao had to choke down a chuckle. If that girl heard her who knows what would happen next.\n\n*Is this a laughing matter?* Guang Qiu berated. *The artifact is about to be taken away for good!*\n\n\"Miss, that bracelet came into our shop just yesterday. It is standard policy not to sell anything that hasn't passed a month of waiting time. This is to give the customer time to redeem their property.\"\n\n\"What kind of shop doesn't sell the things on display?\" Bai Xingwu mocked.\n\nThe man's nose was nearly touching his knees with how low he was bowing, face nearly as red as his uniform. \"I don't know why it was on display, but the records indeed show that the bracelet isn't currently for sale. If you would come back inside, we would be happy to provide a seventy percent discount on your next purchase.\"\n\n\"What nonsense! My father will have this place closed down for this insolence! Do you think the Bai Family is some soft persimmon?\"\n\n\"Wait! Wait!\" came a second, shrill voice from the shop as a tall, skinny man with a pointed beard rushed out. \"Ji Xin, you dare make a fool of yourself here?! How could you treat a valued customer like this?!\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"I'm very sorry miss,\" the skinny man similarly bowed to Bai Xingwu. \"Don't mind anything this idiot says, he's merely worker here.\"\n\n\"Hmmph!\" Bai Xingwu turned up her nose. \"See if I dare shop here again! What rudeness! You will be sure my father will be hearing about this!\"\n\n\"No, no, we wouldn't dare slight the Bai family,\" the man panicked, reaching into his sleeve, he presented a red slip of bamboo to Bai Xingwu with both hands. \"Please, take this voucher. Your next purchase will be entirely free!\"\n\nShe sniffed and delicately took the slip with two fingers. \"At least someone in this awful place knows how to conduct themselves.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned to leave, her two servants showing the pair of men the whites of their eyes.\n\n\"Who do they think their are, speaking that way to the young miss?\"\n\n\"Hmmph, it would serve them right if they get shut down. What a bunch of cheats,\" the servant fished a bamboo whistle from her sleeve and blew three sharp notes on it.\n\nA fine carriage with the Bai family standard painted on its side glided into view, drawn by two handsome white steeds. Bai Xingwu stepped inside, assisted by her two servants. With a tap of a horsewhip, the coachman drew away, blowing a cloud of dust onto the two men who had yet to rise from their bow. Jiaojiao couldn't say she was very fond of the young girl, but she had to admit she had *style*.\n\n*It's over,* Guang Qiu lamented. *What do we do now?*\n\n*So dramatic.*\n\n*Mortal, you don't understand how important that artifact is,* Guang Qiu said, with a heretofore absent measure of patience.\n\n*I do. Without it, I doubt Bai Jing could have accomplished even half of what she did in the book. But so what?*\n\n*What do you mean,* so what?\n\n*You seem to be laboring under the impression that the things Bai Jing wanted and the things I want are one and the same,* Jiaojiao gave Guang Qiu a smile. *Would you believe me if I told you I want nothing to do with that bracelet? I would be happy if that thing never appeared in front of me again.*\n\n*I don't believe you,* Guang Qiu sneered. *A mortal's lust for power is endless. You expect me to believe you don't covet eternal youth and beauty? Knowing how vain you are, I'm surprised you haven't gone insane stuck in that body with that ugly face.*\n\nJiaojiao's smile didn't fade. *Guang Qiu, you saw my body when you picked me up, right? Do you admit that it was very beautiful?*\n\n*I don't pay attention to these things.*\n\n*Well, that body is the only one I acknowledge as mine.* Jiaojiao observed a moment of poignant silence. *Anyway, what difference does it make if I'm stuck in a different body? I don't have any connection to the people in this world. How they see this body, I don't care at all.*\n\n*But this is your life!*\n\nJiaojiao gave Guang Qiu a funny look. *My life ended yesterday. This is just... like some bonus round in a video game.*\n\n*A what?*\n\n*A form of entertainment people in my world engaged in as a way to pass time.*\n\n*How dare you? This is far more important than some game!*\n\n*It may be very important to you. But haven't you got the memo? I don't care at all!*\n\nThe ball drew itself up, unable to digest this statement. *Even if you die?*\n\n*It would be a shame to die again, but I wouldn't be too upset. After all, this place doesn't have running water, internet, amazon or any of the comforts of modern life. Oh, but slavery and human rights violations are everywhere! Not to mention dangerous things like beast tides, and yaoguai and what else?* Jiaojiao made a show of holding her chin. *Oh right, the patriarchy! Mustn't forget that women are second class citizens in this place. If I didn't know any better, I'd think I'd gone to hell and this was a scenario cooked up by demons just to torture me.*\n\nGuang Qiu went still, it's light dimming to an alarming level. It floated there, unresponsive no matter how many times Jiaojiao called it. Her eyes sparkled as she reached out and gave it a poke, but her fingers felt nothing as they passed through its smokey form.\n\n*What are you doing?!*\n\n*I thought you'd suffered a critical error,* she sighed in disappointment. *Is it such a blow, knowing I have no motivation to live?*\n\n*How will the plot progress if the heroine doesn't behave herself?* It asked itself sadly. *My perfect record. Gone.*\n\n*Oh, do you have a hard-ass for a boss? I can relate.*\n\n*This isn't about that at all! Do you have any concept of the havoc a derailed fate-line would wreak? Bai Jing was a force for change in this world! Many events will turn out differently without her presence.*\n\n*Who can say if what she did was for the better?* Jiaojiao sneered. *You read the book. She wasn't some good person that spread love and cheer. She started wars, ended thousands of lives.*\n\n*Even your tiny mortal brain should understand that sometimes hard decisions need to be made for the greater good.*\n\n*I can't agree with that at all. I might not be a good person, and I'm not an expert in ancient court politics, but even I know that a war of succession doesn't need to be fought on the battlefield with the lives of the subjects as fodder!*\n\n*Is that why you don't want to get involved with Mo Wudi? Because you don't want to get involved with the war?*\n\n*Um, there are so many many reasons I don't want to get involved with a seventeen year old boy, but yeah, go ahead, list that as one of them.*\n\n*You think he will put down his quest for revenge without your presence? Don't be a fool! He will be worse without a guiding presence by his side! Bai Jing was the one who kept him from turning this empire into a sea of blood and flame!*\n\nJiaojiao shook her head. *Even if that's true, I can't be the so-called guiding presence.*\n\n*Why not?*\n\n*What right does an outsider to this world have to meddle in its conflicts? Wouldn't someone of this world--*\n\n*It has to be you! No one else will do!* Guang Qiu admitted in a burst of passion.\n\n*Why?*\n\n*I... can't tell you that.*\n\n*Why am I not surprised?* Jiaojiao hefted her staff and made for the door of the pawnshop.\n\n*Where are you going now?*\n\n*You'll see.*\n\nJiaojiao leaned heavily on the staff as she entered the shop. The air was richly scented with sandalwood and ambergris. The worker behind the counter looked up as she stumbled and nearly fell, making a show of dragging her bad leg. The worker's eyes lingered on her dusty robe and her rustic straw hat.\n\n\"Hello,\" she said fretfully, holding a sleeve to her eyes. \"My grandmother came here yesterday to pawn a bracelet. I'm here to redeem it.\"\n\nThe worker, the same man who had tried to stop Bai Xingwu from leaving with the bracelet, avoided Jiaojiao's eyes, as if he already knew which bracelet and which grandmother she was speaking of. \"May I see your token?\"\n\nJiaojiao placed Cen Wei's token on the counter. \"It's' a keepsake of my dear mother, but I fell down some stairs and broke my leg yesterday--\" she sniffed, blinking back a a dewy batch of tears, \"--but we didn't have the money! So my grandmother--\"\n\n\"It's been sold.\" The hapless man looked very much like he wanted the ground to open up and eat him. \"I'm very sorry.\"\n\nJiaojiao drew her head back, as if unable to comprehend his words. \"What?\"\n\n\"I'm very sorry, the bracelet has been sold.\"\n\n\"But... shouldn't there be a thirty day waiting period?\"\n\n\"It was our mistake,\" the man bowed his head. \"I will take responsibility and compensate you with another bracelet if you so wish.\"\n\nJiaojiao's tears ran freely down her cheeks. \"But I don't w-want another b-bracelet, I want my mother's bracelet!\"\n\n*How ugly. You think you can charm him with those ugly looks of yours?* Guang Qiu muttered.\n\n\"I'm very very sorry!\" the man said, his young face creased in distress. \"I will compensate you the full price of what we gave that girl today!\"\n\n\"Wait just a minute!\" a shrill voice cut in. \"What do you think you're doing Ji Xin?\"\n\n\"This young miss--\"\n\n\"Why are you wasting time with a peasant? Just drive her out.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Is this how you conduct business?!\" Jiaojiao screeched through her tears, her attitude going from helpless waif to belligerent shrew. \"I demand to know where my bracelet has gone!\"\n\n\"It's been sold!\" the man with the pointy beard pointed at Jiaojiao's face, \"what an ugly girl! You have the face to come out in public and scare people? Just crawl back to the countryside from where you came! Don't dirty people's eyes!\"\n\n\"Hah! You want to drive me out with that?\" Jiaojiao drew her staff up as if gearing up for battle. \"You think I'm ugly? Heh! Your face will be worst after I'm done with you! Just see if I let you do business in this town again! I'll shout from the rooftops how the Ji clan doesn't know how to conduct business! How their pawnshop cheats honest people! See if I don't!\"\n\nThe pointy-bearded man sneered. \"You're just a little girl! What can you do? That bracelet was sold to the Bai family, go take it up with them if you dare!\"\n\n\"Heh! You think the poor are easily bullied? Just wait and see! All I have to do is say two words in the ears of those gossiping servants down at market. You'll be the talk of the town tomorrow!\"\n\n\"You dare--\"\n\nThe young man--Ji Xin, hastily pulled the skinny man aside bending close to whisper in his ear. The two had an angry protracted conversation while Jiaojiao impatiently rapped her staff on the ground.\n\nThe younger man soon came back, his handsome face creased in a smile. \"I'm very sorry for the wait,\" he said, sliding a pouch over the counter.\n\nJiaojiao sniffed and pulled the pouch open. Inside were several silver coins. \"Was that so hard?\"\n\nThe pointy-bearded man looked as if he was ready to murder. Jiaojiao flashed a smile, then simply turned to leave.\n\n*You're a cheat,* Guang Qiu said. *Cen Wei was already paid for the bracelet. How does that man calculate? Their business will be run into the ground sooner or later if they keep this up.*\n\n*You can't put a price on reputation,* Jiaojiao smiled. *Merchants don't have high social class to begin with. If they are accused of corruption, the officials will swoop in and then they'll have nothing. Besides, it's a fact that they broke their own rules.*\n\nJiaojiao relaxed into the rickshaw, allowing her mind to wander. It was taxing on her starved body to drag her dead leg about. She was done with the day hours ago.\n\nIt wasn't until she jolted awake in a dark, deserted alley that she realized something had gone very wrong.\n\n*Wake up, mortal! You're in danger!*\n\n*Guang Qiu, what's happening?* she asked groggily. Her sleepiness was short-lived, however, when she noticed the young rickshaw driver had climbed over the back of the cart and had a dagger pointed at her throat.\n\n*Isn't it obvious?* Guang Qiu sighed. *You're being robbed.*","lastmodified":"2022-04-15T11:37:36.43780101Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/Chapter13-Tu-Wenfeng":{"title":"Chapter 12-Tu Wenfeng","content":"\"Hand over all your money!\" the boy said, pressing the dagger against her neck. His face was stoic, but his voice was young and trembling.\n\nJiaojiao shifted away from the cold steel, but it followed her, close as a shadow. A prick announced that the knife had broken skin. The young rickshaw driver's face, tense and drawn with adrenaline jerked at the sight of blood trickling down her neck.\n\n*What luck. I've conned a sum out of that pawnshop and now it's my turn.*\n\n*There is a thing such as karma,* Guang Qiu said smugly. \n\nIt would be the smart thing to do, to hand over the money, but Jiaojiao was tired of the universe trampling over her. First she'd been downloaded into this ruin of a body, then she'd had to deal with Cen Wei, that sadistic servant feeding her garbage among other things. She'd had her leg broken this morning. She'd nearly had a heart attack being embraced by Mo Wudi, that psycho. She'd been dealing with Guang Qiu's non-stop nagging. \n\n\"I'm done,\" Jiaojiao announced to the world at large. \"If this is where I die, so be it!\"\n\n\"Did you hear me?\" the boy gestured with his free hand, \"give me all your money!\"\n\nJiaojiao's eyes caught on a long jagged scar on his left forearm and fell deep into thought. \n\n*What are you waiting for?* Guang Qiu said nervously. *If you don't give him the money then you really will die.*\n\n*What are the chances that I meet three new characters in the book all in one day?* Jiaojiao asked.\n\nGuang Qiu paused. *I only count two, Mo Wudi and Doctor Tai. Who else?*\n\n*It's three. If I'm not mistaken, this young man is Tu Wenfeng,*\n\n*Ah! He has the same scar! You might be right!* Guang Qiu vibrated with agitation. *But how can this be? Shouldn't he only appear in chapter thirty? We haven't even reached chapter three yet in terms of time passage! This is no good! The chronology is a mess!*\n\n\"Isn't this bullying the infirm?\" Jiaojiao tsked. \"You should be ashamed of yourself. Robbing the sick.\"\n\nThe boy turned red, though his expression didn't change. \"I'm sorry, but I have a very important use for this money.\"\n\n*Say, he's blushing from shame. Why does this seem very different from the Tu Wenfeng in the book? Wasn't this guy supposed to be a merciless thief and killer?*\n\nThis seemed to set Guang Qiu at ease. *Maybe you're mistaken and this isn't Tu Wenfeng after all.*\n\n*I don't know. Perhaps something happened between now and chapter 30 that caused his personality to undergo a change.*\n\n\"Important enough to cast your morals to the wayside?\" Jiaojiao asked the boy. \"You are strong and able-bodied, what is it that's keeping you from earning the money?\"\n\n\"I don't have the time. Please just give me the money, I don't want to hurt you.\"\n\n\"Every thief in the world thinks they have a better use for the money they steal than those they're stealing from,\" Jiaojiao shook her head. \"You think you're desperate enough to kill, then go ahead.\"\n\n*Mortal, are you stupid? Why are you provoking him?*\n\n*Relax, if he had the guts to kill me for this bit of change, then he would have slit my throat instead of trying to negotiate. Honestly, who says \"please\" to the people they're robbing?*\n\nHaving decided that he'd waited long enough, Tu Wenfeng's feet shifted as he stepped in closer, reaching toward Jiaojiao's sleeve where she kept the coin pouch. \"Don't resist, I know your leg is injured.\"\n\nJiaojiao suddenly jerked up the staff resting on her knees and knocked his knife away.\n\n\"Ah!\" the boy cursed and bent down to scrabble for the knife on the dirty alley floor.\n\nJiaojiao didn't budge from her seat, because really, how far would she get with her leg? She rest her chin in her hand as she lounged against the side of the rickshaw, watching the boy spring up with the retrieved dagger.\n\n\"Why don't you tell me more about what you need the money for? Maybe if you move me with your sincerity, I'll give it to you.\"\n\nThe boy hesitated, fingering the dagger with shaking hands. \"What if you decide you don't want to give the money?\"\n\n\"Then we can fight it out! Cripple to rickshaw driver!\" she tapped her bad leg. \"What are you worried about? It's not like I can run away.\"\n\nThe boy bowed his head. \"There's a girl...\"\n\n*Jesus, spare me. Why is it always a girl?* Jiaojiao clicked her tongue. \"And what? You hope to gather enough riches to impress her and you can go riding into the sunset together and live happily ever after?\"\n\nThe boy turned a vivid, bruised, red. \"It's not like that!\"\n\n\"What? Just because you have a girl you like, you can rob whoever you like?\"\n\n\"If I don't gather enough money to redeem her, she will become a brothel worker. She comes of age in a month. I don't have the time to be earning coppers when buying her would cost fifty silver taels.\" The boy turned a frustrated look the rickshaw. \n\n*Uhhh... was this part of his backstory?* Jiaojiao asked Guang Qiu. *This is why he became an amoral mercenary? He lost his little lover to a brothel? Why wasn't this in the book?*\n\n*I'm not sure. The book can't include every little thing that happens to every character or the author would never rest!*\n\n*I suppose you have a point. Speaking of which, why is a webnovel written by some middle schooler dictating the events in your world anyway?*\n\n*Hehe, trying to get more information from me?* Guang Qiu mocked. *Keep dreaming, mortal.*\n\n\"I don't have fifty taels on me,\" Jiaojiao confessed. \"Even if you rob me, you'll have to go on to rob others, unless of course you happen to have the difference on you?\"\n\nThe boy looked on eyes wide, as Jiaojiao shook out her sleeves into her lap and began counting change. \"I have fifteen taels, how much do you have?\"\n\n\"I--I--\"\n\nJiaojiao clapped her hands, eyes sparkling. \"That gives me an idea! I have a business proposition for you.\"\n\n\"W-what?\"\n\n\"Listen, I'm not exactly rich either, but I have ways to make money. Unfortunately, I can't do much with my body the way it is. I need someone who can act for me. I can supply the ideas while you do the rough work. Deal?\"\n\n\"What sort of ideas?\" the boy asked, interest piqued.\n\n*What do you think you're doing?!* Guang Qiu roared. *What nonsense! Just give him the money and leave! You shouldn't even be talking to him!*\n\n*Oh, spare me. What do you think will happen when he finishes robbing me? You think he would be kind enough to drop me off at the Bai Estate?*\n\nGuang Qiu choked.\n\n*Exactly, I'll be stranded in this alley with no money and no way to get home! I might as well toss all my chips in and hope for the best!*\n\n*He seems like an agreeable young man, perhaps if you ask nicely--*\n\n*No way! I already owe Hu Maoxun, like, ten taels of silver!* Jiaojiao shot Guang Qiu a sharp look. *Haven't you heard that debt is the slavery of the free? I absolutely can't abide being in debt. You know what my biggest problem is?*\n\n*That you've lost the artifact?*\n\n*Idiot! It's money! So what if Bai Xingwu has the artifact, right? \n\n*Right?*\n\n*So, how do I get it back from her? Because realistically, do you think this body, with my soul, is capable of sneaking into her courtyard and past all the guards and whatever servants she has?*\n\n*You... you...* Guang Qiu dimmed. *What then?*\n\n*If I had money, I could just hire someone to steal it back from her!*\n\n*Hah! Good luck! With the Bai Family's reputation, you think anyone would be willing to cross them for some pocket change?*\n\n*You're thinking too simply. The Bai family is powerful, but that just means they have powerful enemies. Besides, you think the people in the Jianghu care about things like social status? Wasn't Bai Jing able to find a lot of helpers there who didn't give a crap about the Bai family?*\n\nGuang Qiu chewed on this for a minute. *I suppose you have a point.*\n\n\"Hello? Miss? Are you alright? What are you looking at?\" Tu Wenfeng asked, peering at the empty air where Guang Qiu floated.\n\n\"Nothing, I'm just thinking,\" Jiaojiao said. \"As for ideas, I can name a few. Are there many tanneries in the capital?\"\n\n\"Yes, there's at least ten,\" Tu Wenfeng answered. \"Why?\"\n\n\"You'll see,\" Jiaojiao smiled.\n\nTu Wenfeng stared at her skeptically, his grasp on the dagger tightening ominously.\n\n*Looks like you couldn't convince him,* Guang Qiu sighed.\n\n\"If you don't believe me, take me to a place you can keep me secured. It's not like it would be hard to keep me from running away. Like your house,\" Jiaojiao paused. \"You do have a house, don't you?\"\n\n\"M-my house? You want to go to my house?\" the boy drew back as he were a child at a park and Jiaojiao was some creepy weirdo with an iconic white van.\n\n\"What's the matter?\"\n\n\"Y-you're a young girl, shouldn't you be more mindful of propriety?\" the boy looked away, cheeks flaming.\n\n\"What, are you saying I can't trust you, or that you can't trust me?\" Jiaojiao gave Tu Wenfeng a mocking stare. \"What are you worried about? That this cripple will take advantage of you?\"\n\nLooking as if he thought he was doing something very stupid, the boy hesitantly sheathed his dagger and took up the two posts at the front of the rickshaw. He glanced back a Jiaojiao a few times before shaking his head and taking off in a brisk jog.\n\n*You've done it. You've managed to con him. This makes your second victim of the day,* Guang Qiu said, half-stunned, half-reproachful. \n\n*Why do you think it's a con? I'm very serious about this. I never joke about money,* Jiaojiao leaned back in the rickshaw shifting her numb ass. \n\n*What can you possibly do to earn money?* Guang Qiu asked with a skeptical hum. *You think starting a business is easy? I'm not an expert at the affairs of mortals but even I know that this is far from a simple endeavor--* a pause *--or are you simply out to run another scam? Even scams aren't easy to pull off--\n\n*Would you quit calling me a scammer?*\n\nThe two bickered to pass the time. The rickshaw passed over a wide bridge with three lanes of traffic, two for carts and one for pedestrians. A uniformed guard dressed in layered leather armor and a dark blue uniform gestured back and forth, directing traffic and scolding those that veered out of their lane. Jiaojiao held her nose at the foul smell as they passed over the water. With no modern sanitation and hygeine, the river flowing through the city was an awful green. \n\nThere was a change in scenery on the opposite side of the canal. Soon Jiaojiao noticed their surroundings were becoming ever more dull and depressed. Run-down shanties and collapsed wooden structures lined the streets. A beggar crouched by the side of the road, his leg oozing with pus and sores. He held a wooden bowl out to Jiaojiao as the rickshaw passed, but Tu Wenfeng sped up and the beggar was left in the dust. Skinny children sat in doorways, or ran naked in the streets, women with tired faces crouched over basins of cloudy water, washing garments by hand.\n\nTu Wenfeng didn't pause to let Jiaojiao take in the sights, seeming to speed up more and more the nearer he got to his destination. At last, they slowed and came to a stop outside a dingy compound that looked like a wooden cousin to Bai Xingyue's courtyard. A gaggle of dirty-faced children burst out of the entryway and crowded around Tu Wenfeng. Seemingly a thousand young voices called out at once, asking who is this girl?\n\nTu Wenfeng turn toward Jiaojiao, two children hanging from his neck. \"We're here.\"","lastmodified":"2022-04-15T11:37:36.43780101Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/Chapter14-The-Slum-Temple":{"title":"Chapter 14-The Slum Temple","content":"Jiaojiao shrunk back as the children crowded around the creaky rickshaw. Their hands reaching for her staff, her robes, her face, and poked curiously at her splinted leg.\n\nTu Wenfeng straightened,  back rigid as he the children gazed up at him with laughing faces. \"Tutu! You're back! Did you bring anything good to eat?\"\n\n\"Alright, get away!\" Tu Wenfeng barked, pulling the rickshaw into the entryway, not at all minding the three or four toddlers clinging to his legs and back. \"Get out of the way! What if the rickshaw runs you over?\"\n\nApparently this possibility only caused the children greater amusement, as even more jumped on Tu Wenfeng's back and one even crawled into the rickshaw with Jiaojiao, squeezing next to her broken leg until the newly set bone creaked ominously.\n\nIf Mo Wudi had nearly given her a heart attack, then these children were close to giving her an aneurism.\n\n\"Get out of the cart Min Tong, you stupid ghost!\" Tu Wenfeng scolded without venom. \"Can't you see she's injured?\"\n\nMin Tong, a monkey-faced pipsqueak shot gave Jiaojiao a pout, but obediently jumped out of the rickshaw.\n\nTu Wenfeng parked the cart next to a crumbling wall, then turned awkwardly to Jiaojiao, who was hesitant to descend the cart into perilous goblin territory. She watched as the children milled about the rickshaw, speaking over one another to be heard.\n\n\"Who is she?\"\n\n\"Tutu, what about Yanyan? Are you treading on two boats?\"\n\n\"How could you forget Yanyan for this ghost face?\"\n\n\"What's that mark on her face?\"\n\nJiaojiao almost felt self-conscious. Children after all, had no filter. Even if she told herself she didn't have any reason to feel ashamed of her appearance, she still felt a stab of annoyance. She turned to that bratty voice and smiled. \n\n\"What's your name? Min Tong?\"\n\nThe little boy thrust out his chin. \"Yeah, that's me.\"\n\n\"This red mark on my face is a sign of a curse,\" Jiaojiao said with a bitter sigh. \"A goddess saw that I was more beautiful than her, so she cursed me to look--\" she took her sleeve and rubbed away the rest of the powder, revealing the ugly mark in all it's mottled veiny glory \"--like this!\"\n\nMin Tong gaped at Jiaojiao's face for a whole second, then screamed as if he was being lit on fire. \"Monster! It's a guai! Guai!\" \n\nA wet stain appeared between his legs as he ran away as quickly as his stubby two legs could carry him, screaming all the while.\n\nLike a devastating chemical reaction, two more children took one look at Jiaojiao's face, then began to scream, similar wet puddles appearing at their feet. Three, then seven more children ran away, fleeing from the scene of carnage.\n\nTu Wenfeng stared at Jiaojiao's uncovered face, then the gaggle of distressed children on the far side of the courtyard.\n\n\"What? They were noisy.\"\n\n\"You didn't have to frighten them into pissing themselves.\"\n\n\"What is this place?\"\n\n\"It's a temple for the Goddess Nuwa,\" he gave Jiaojiao a pointed look. \"You shouldn't speak so freely about gods in this place, they may hear you.\"\n\nJiaojiao bit back a sarcastic remark, remembering once again she was in a place of gods and demons. \"Not going to comment on this?\" Jiaojiao she said insteadn, pointing at the mark on her face. \n\n\"It's none of my business.\"\n\n\"I commend your conduct,\" Jiaojiao applauded. \"It's fine, I'll tell anyway.  Anyway, so the goddess--\"\n\n*What nonsense are you spouting?* Guang Qiu interrupted. *Are you calling Head Wife Zhang a goddess?*\n\n\"She said that as long as I earn a hundred gold ingots and donate them in her name, then the curse will be lifted.\"\n\n*Why would a goddess care about mortal wealth? What utter--* \n\n\"What is your plan to earn money?\" Tu Wenfeng said. \"I've brought you to my home. You hold up your end of the deal.\"\n\nJiaojiao put down her hands. \"Fine.\"\n\nTu Wenfeng looked away as Jiaojiao struggled down from the cart, only turning back to here when she made an impatient noise. She thumped her staff and gestured. \"Aren't you going to invite me to sit down? You expect to have a conversation while standing around? Might I remind you my leg is injured. \"\n\nThe teenager looked like he was approaching the end of his patience, but led the way into a run-down wooden house with floorboards creaking with each step. \n\nThe children had gotten over their upset and drew closer to them , peering around the edge of the doorway as Tu Wenfeng invited Jiaojiao a seat at the low table and a ratty floor cushion.\n\nJiaojiao had never missed modern furniture more than this moment as she awkwardly lowered herself to sit on the floor, leg pointed outward like a fallen tree.\n\n\"I mentioned some money making ideas, but they are all dependent on your cooperation. I can't do much by myself. Furthermore, much of it requires man power.\"\n\n\"I'm strong.\"\n\n\"Not the power I meant. I mean many able hands, they don't necessarily need to be as strong as you,\" Jiaojiao glanced at the children, who fled screaming at the sight of her face. \"I suppose children would do just fine. Unless there's child labor laws I don't know about?\"\n\n\"Child labor what?\"\n\nJiaojiao threw up a hand. \"I supposed I was worried for no reason.\"\n\n\"Anyhow,\" Jiaojiao placed the pouch on the scarred table. \"I suppose you've been operating in good faith by bringing me here, you can keep a hold of the money.\" \n\nThe pouch disappeared beyond Tu Wenfeng's lapels. \n\n*You are too optimistic,* Guang Qiu sneered. *What makes you think he'll listen to anything you say? What if spends the money randomly?*\n\n*With his girlfriend's life on the line? Unlikely. If I didn't give him the money, he would have taken it sooner or later. The only reason he brought me here is because he's hesitant to kill me. He most likely doesn't have high hopes for whatever I have to say, but he's desperate enough to try.*\n\n\"Do you have any paper?\" Jiaojiao said outloud.\n\nTu Wenfeng took a sardonic glance around the room. \"Does it look like we can afford something so expensive.\"\n\n*Yikes, Iooks like paper is out of play.* \"Fine, can you at least get me some bamboo slips and ink?\"\n\n\"Bamboo is easy, but ink is more difficult.\"\n\n\"Well, you can't expect me to write in the mud with a stick, can you?\" Jiaojiao said.\n\nTwo minutes later, they were sitting in the entryway, Jiaojiao with a stick confiscated from a child squeezed in her hand.\n\nIrritably, she began to scratch out hesitant characters in the dirt.\n\n*Why is your writing so ugly?*\n\n*Well, if your writing looks any better using a stick, then I applaud you. Besides, you should be thankful I know traditional Chinese at all. In my world, most people use simplified.*\n\nSlowly a list of jagged characters appeared on the ground. \n\nMaterials to get:\n- tannery scraps, leather doesn't need to be large, but shouldn't have defects if you can help it\n- twine; ~~silk~~, hemp or cotton. ~~(is silk too expensive? It probably is nevermind.)~~\n- river stones: should be smooth, with interesting colors or patterns are preferred but not absolutely necessary\n- paper: it doesn't need to be very good quality, just enough to write clearly on.\n\nTu Wenfeng scowled down at it. \"What is this gibberish?\"\n\n\"This is phase one,\" Jiaojiao said mysteriously. \"Of course, all of this is dependent on whether we can source materials. Am I to understand there is a mercenary guild in this town?\"\n\n\"What does that have to do with anything? We can't afford to hire anyone.\"\n\n\"We aren't hiring to them, we're selling!\"\n\n\"What could we possibly have that would be--\"\n\n\"Okay enough questions!\" Jiaojiao clapped her hands together briskly. \"I've upheld my end of the deal. You have the money. It's your move.\"\n\nTu Wenfeng stared at her, and she could tell he was very close to just driving her out, sans money, morals be damned.\n\n\"Don't you want to save your Yanyan? You think that beggar's pittance will be enough to buy her?\"\n\nTu Wenfeng closed his eyes and sighed. \"Very well, I hope you aren't lying to me or simply a fool.\"\n\nJiaojiao gave him a set of detailed instructions, then slouched over the low table. *This day has been far too long.*\n\n*It's only the afternoon.*\n\n*Don't remind me.*\n\nAn old woman, squinting in the dim light, tottered into the room under a basket of dirty linens. \"Tutu? What is happening?\" she blinked myopically at Jiaojiao. \"We have a visitor?\"\n\n\"This is...\" he glanced to Jiaojiao, \"I didn't catch your name.\"\n\n\"You can call me Jiaojiao.\"\n\nHe made the introductions briefly, explained to the half-deaf old woman, named Chu Hua, in a loud voice that Jiaojiao would be staying with them for a few days. \n\nChu Hua sighed and waved a hand in exasperation. \"Everyday he brings home another stray.\"\n\nTu Wenfeng left shortly after to finish the day's work and perhaps find some of what Jiaojiao had instructed. The old woman went out the door, bent in half under the weight of her basket. Children streamed after her, asking questions.\n\n\"Did you talk with the guai, Granny Hua?\"\n\n\"Did you see it's face?\"\n\n\"Is it here to eat us?\"\n\n\"Granny, let me help!\"\n\n\"Aiya!\" Chu Hua cried out, seeing all the children with wet trousers and soiled robes. \"Haven't I told you not to wait to go to the outhouse?\"\n\n\"It wasn't our fault!\" Min Tong stood out front, all three feet of him trembling as he pointed at Jiaojiao. \"It was that monster over there!\"\n\nJiaojiao turned a deaf ear as the children heaped a layer of accusations on her, though she spared a guilty glance over all the extra washing that would no doubt fall on that overworked granny.\n\n*What do you hope to achieve in this run-down place? Besides traumatizing children?* Guang Qiu asked gloomily. *This is a waste of time.*\n\n*It isn't a waste,* Jiaojiao's eyes shone. *This is an opportunity! Besides, this place isn't much worse than Bai Xingyue's courtyard. What does it matter if I'm suffering here or I'm suffering there? Not to mention, doesn't Bai Xingwu like to visit every so often to torment Bai Xingyue? Isn't it wise to stay away from that pink calamity until my leg isn't quite so brittle?* \n\nThe granny shote Jiaojiao a confused look, then towed the crowd of children away like a flagship. Jiaojiao enjoyed the afternoon sunlight streaming though the open doorway, not even blinking an eye at the straggling children who stayed to goggle at her or whisper about her supposed demonic attributes.\n\n*You aren't at all uncomfortable being seen as a monster by these children?*\n\n*Why should I worry about what a bunch of crotch goblins think? Besides, most of them have their own problems.* Jiaojiao gestured at a young boy missing his left arm, arguing with that pissant, Min Tong as he dug a hole in the soft dirt of the courtyard with a stick. *For example, I'm at least better off than him. I have all my limbs. Or that girl over there. Does't she have a hare-lip? If they can play happily together with her, it won't be long until they accept me. Right?*\n\nThe granny came back with an empty basket, the children peeling away from her when she entered the house, hesitant to come closer to the ghost-faced girl. \"The children seem to like you.\"\n\n\"Is that what this is?\"\n\n\"If they didn't like you, they would be throwing mud,\" she laughed wearily. \"Many donations have flown away due to their behavior.\" She didn't seem angry at this occurrence.\n\n\"What happened to this temple?\" Jiaojiao asked.\n\nShe sighed, eyes cloudy as she gazed at the timeworn surroundings. \"It's fallen on hard times and isn't as popular as it once was after they built a newer one in a cleaner part of the capital. No one comes here anymore unless it's to get rid of a burden. It's become a place for abandoned children. Whether it's because their family is too poor, or they have other things that aren't acceptable, they end up here.\"\n\n\"Do they become monks?\"\n\nThe granny nodded. \"Some of them. A monk visits every year. If a suitable child is found, they move to another temple in the mountains. However, not many get picked. Even the gods don't want the ones that end up here.\"\n\nJiaojiao smiled mirthlessly. *It seems the more things are different, the more they are the same.*\n\n*What does that mean?*\n\n*Nevermind. Just thought of something sad from the past. It all started when I was a young child, there was a--* Jiaojiao trailed off, eyes misty with unshed tears.\n\n*There was a what?* Guang Qiu asked.\n\nJiaojiao shot Guang Qiu a provocative look. *Why, you curious?*\n\n*What? Why would I care about your past--*\n\n*Oh. Then I won't tell you.*\n\nGuang Qiu buzzed, choked into silence. \"You--\"\n\nChu Hua woman gazed blearily at the same spot where Guang Qiu hung in the air. \"Is there something on the wall? My old eyes aren't very good. If there's a cockroach, don't mind it. As long as you wipe your mouth after you eat, they should leave you alone.\"\n\nJiaojiao turned a set of wide eyes on Chu Hua. \"You have cockroaches?\"\n\n\"They usually only come out at night, but if it rains you will see more,\" she said conversationally. \"Did you not have them where you used to live?\"\n\n*Guang Qiu, we are leaving right away!*\n\n*Hehe, aren't you exactly where you wanted to be? What's the use of crying to me now?* \n\n*What do you understand? Cockroaches! I've never even seen on in real life before!*\n\n*Why are you so disturbed? They aren't so different from every other bug.*\n\n*Not so different? I beg to fucking differ!*\n\nChu Hua turned a concerned eye at the frozen Jiaojiao, whose face was going through several expressions in rapid succession as she stared at nothing.\n\n\"Tutu always finds the oddest ones.\"","lastmodified":"2022-04-15T11:37:36.43780101Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/NaNoWriMo-April-2022":{"title":"üå± NaNoWriMo-April 2022","content":"---\n\nI've had this idea for a book series bouncing around for quite some time and [NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org/what-is-camp-nanowrimo) was just the excuse that I needed to jumpstart the whole endeavor.

So yeah, the magic system and the characters in this story aren't going to be the most original thing ever.
