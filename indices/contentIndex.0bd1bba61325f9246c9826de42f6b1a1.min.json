From the scuffed corners of the _hongmu_ armoire, to the cracked surface of the low tea table with mother of pearl inlay, every detail screamed of bygone grandeur. The mustiness in the air hinted at age and neglect.\n\nJIaojiao didn't react for a good ten seconds, staring here and there at the ratty paper windows, thrice mended and patched with ragged bits of cloth, at the exposed brown bricks beyond the cracked lime plaster, at the moth eaten covers over her too-small lap. She held up her bony hands, chapped, with yellowed uneven nails.\n\n\"Oh no,\" Jiaojiao spoke aloud. \"I'm having a stroke.\"\n\nBecause, that could be the only explanation for this... this farce of a hallucination, right? She had only just been arguing with... who was it? Right, Superb_Ninja2394, defending her controversial decision to pair Galaxy Sunrise nail polish with hot pink stripes and gold decals. Why else would she be seeing this scene out of a half-baked period drama. It was a stroke.\n\nA stroke. It had to be.\n\nBecause... what would be the alternative?\n\nWith mounting horror, Jiaojiao was swiftly coming to the realization that this body was not her body. Jiaojiao used her not-her-hands to touch her not-her-face. It was small, thin, and _unmoisturized_. _Who was this person?_\n\nShe didn't get to dwell on it further before the door to the bedroom burst open with a crack of distressed wood.\n\n\"Bai Xingyue, you slut!\" cried a sweet young voice.\n\nFramed in the doorway, with her leg still raised in a high-kick, was a young girl in a pink _hanfu_, perhaps twelve to fifteen years old. Pearled hairpins in the shapes of flowers and birds bobbed with her movements. Her tender face was scrunched in a scowl that was more cute in the way of angry kittens and growling puppies, than intimidating.\n\nBai Xingyue? Is she talking about _not-me_?\n\nThe girl didn't waste a second rushing into the room, hand raised in a maneuver Jiaojiao recognized well as the classic posture for a slap, so well exemplified in Chinese harem dramas. She shifted out of the way, though her body responded much more sluggishly than she was used to.\n\nThe angry girl's pink embroidered sleeves billowed as her fist landed on the traditional _kang_ bed. Rather than bouncing off the woven bottom as Jiaojiao expected, that tiny fist blasted through in an explosion of bamboo shards.\n\n\"You dare dodge?!\" The girl screeched, then pouted at the _audacity_.\n\nJiaojiao was too baffled to speak. So should she stay still and get her head smashed in? What the hell? Was this ninety pound loli She-ra incarnate?\n\n\"I-- I'm sorry?\" Jiaojiao finally rasped out, noting that the voice was not her voice, but what else was new? The moment the words were out of her-- _not-her mouth_, there was a brief buzz in Jiaojiao's mind. Jiaojiao frowned, raising a hand to her head. More signs she was having a stroke, surely.\n\n\"You think apologizing is enough?\" the girl sneered, hand raised for another slap. \"You slut. Why didn't you just drown in that pond?¬†You think such lowly tactics would attract the crown prince? Naive!\"\n\nWhat was this about a crown prince? So this is a historical drama? What dynasty? Is this a drama with wuxia elements? Jiaojiao thought wildly to herself. How else to explain this girls strength? Why am I even thinking about this? I could be dying right as we speak, brain cells withering from lack of oxygen! Are the paramedics even on the way? Knowing her usual audience they wouldn't care to call for help even if it became obvious rigor was setting in.\n\n_Doomed. I'm doomed._\n\nThe pink loli didn't take kindly to being ignored. Jiaojiao felt a distinct danger to her hallucinatory life as that white hand descended for another slap. She hastily rolled away though she felt serious doubts about her current situation. Surely none of this mattered even if her head did became roadkill? That is-- If she truly was having a stroke. The bed groaned as another hole appeared by the first.\n\n\"The crown prince wouldn't even deign to let you lick his shoes! You're a toad lusting for swan meat!\" The girl sneered. \"You should just kill yourself and save me the trouble of dirtying my hands!\"\n\n\"The crown prince?\" Jiaojiao parroted, curled up in the corner of the bed, bracketed by wall and headboard and and covered in bamboo slivers.\n\n\"You still have the face to speak of the crown prince!?\"\n\nThird slap incoming, Jiaojiao had run out of rolling space. She hastily raised both hands in a gesture of surrender. \"Wait!\"\n\nThe girl paused and regarded Jiaojiao in disgust. Behind her, two servants in plain blue robes had entered at some point and were staring at Jiaojiao in shaudenfraude.\n\n\"I have no interest in the crown prince,\" Jiaojiao said. It was the truth, who was this crown prince even?\n\n\"Hah! As if I would believe your lies!\"\n\n\"Hold on!\" Jiaojiao called, interrupting that hand descending like a guillotine. \"I-- I've lost my memories!\"\n\n\"Hah?\" The girl glared, but the hand remained suspended.\n\n\"I... don't even know who you are?\" Jiaojiao supplied.\n\nThe girl scrutinized Jiaojiao from head to toe, as if there would be physical signs to elude to the veracity of that statement. She leaned forward, staring into Jiaojiao's face.\n\n\"Don't believe her, young miss,\" one of the servants interrupted.\n\n\"She's just lying to escape punishment,\" the other servant agreed.\n\nJiaojiao met the girl's gaze straight on. \"I really truly have lost my memories. I don't even know my own name.\"\n\n\"What a liar,\" the first servant laughed. \"Just slap her to death.\"\n\n\"Slap her to death!\"\n\n_What is wrong with these people?_\n\n\"Hmph,\" the girl finally smiled. \"So what if you don't remember? Now hold still so I can rid the world of an eyesore.\"\n\n\"You really want to kill her-- me?\" Jiaojiao asked doubtfully.\n\n\"You finally understand,\" the girl smiled. Objectively, it was a nice smile on a pretty face, but it made the hairs stand up on the back of Jiaojiao's neck.\n\n\"Can we talk about this?\" Jiaojiao scrunched herself as far as she could go into the corner.\n\n\"What is there to talk about? You should have died back there in that pond. I'm just finishing the job.\"\n\nJiaojiao could only watch as that hand resumed its merciless descent, a harsh buzz began in her mind as the palm neared her unprotected face. The buzz reached an annoying crescendo then cut off with a wrathful pop.\n\nA bright box bloomed into view, floating in Jiaojiao's vision like a phantom.\n\nSimultaneously, the girl's descending slap suddenly veered off to the right and hit the wall with a crackle of broken plaster.\n\nThough her face had narrowly escaped getting pancaked by mere millimeters, Jiaojiao could only stare at the floating box in befuddlement. It was a translucent screen with a block of white text scrolling past and looked like something out of a VR simulation.\n\nThe girl hissed and shook out her blushing palm, smarting from the impact to the brick wall. \"You bitch, how dare you dodge!?\"\n\nThe servants darted forward, cooing in distress over their mistress's hand.\n\n\"You wretch! How could you hurt the miss's hand like this!\"\n\nJiaojiao was too distracted to answer, eyes riveted on the contents of that floating box.\n\n*Bai Jing woke in a dirty old bedroom...**\n\n_Bai Jing smiled enchantingly as she caught Bai Xingwu's hand in an iron fist..._\n\n_Bai Jing kicked the girl away with her slim leg..._\n\n_Bai Jing slapped the impudent servant..._\n\n_Bai Jing..._\n\n\"Who the fuck is Bai Jing?\" Jiaojiao said.\n\nThe girl and the two servants stared agog at her outburst.\n\n\"Is there a Bai Jing in the family?\"\n\n\"I don't think so.\"\n\n\"What is she staring at?\"\n\n\"Maybe she's finally gone crazy.\"\n\n\"Heh! If I were her, I would've have gone crazy when I first heard I was a martial cripple.\"\n\n\"I would have just hung myself and ended it all.\"\n\n\"How could the crown prince have such a hideous toad for a fianc√©?\"\n\nThe servants tittered.\n\n\"Silence!\" The girl snapped, still rubbing her sore hand. \"Don't speak of the crown prince with your lowly mouths!\"\n\nThe servants bowed their heads. Though chastised, the corners of their lips turned up as they snuck glances at Jiaojiao and the girl in pink, no doubt anticipating the ensuing carnage.\n\nWhat bunch of manipulative she-devils.\n\nJiaojiao finally turned her gaze back to the bristling girl in pink, having finished digesting the contents of the floating box-- though not all of it made sense, she was beginning to get a hint of what was going on.\n\n\"Is your name Bai Xingwu?\"\n\nThe girl curled her lip up in ridicule. \"I thought you lost your memories?\"\n\n\"So it is.\"\n\n\"Don't think pretending to be crazy will get you out of anything!\"\n\n\"What do you want to do?\" Jiaojiao asked, exasperated. \"Should I just lie down and let you kill me?\"\n\n\"It would be your honor to be killed by me!\"\n\nJiaojiao refrained from rolling her eyes. \"What can I do so that you won't kill me?\"\n\nBai Xingwu smiled, eyes crinkling in mirthful crescents. \"Kowtow. Kowtow until I tell you to stop.\"\n\nAnd what if you never tell me to stop? Jiaojiao could already predict the outcome. \"Fine,\" she said with a diplomatic smile and crawled off of the _kang_, wincing as her right leg twinged in pain.\n\nJiaojiao shuffled awkwardly to the dusty floor, then knelt, right knee now screaming in protest. There was definitely something up with that leg but she didn't currently have the time to address it. She took a moment to admire Bai Xingwu's pearl-studded shoes, then lowered her head in the first kowtow.\n\nThe harsh buzzing began anew.\n\n_It's all a stroke anyway! Why am I worrying?_\n\nOnly Jiaojiao knew herself fairly well, and she wasn't imaginative enough to dream this shit up by far.\n\nShe was feeling pain in a hallucination, not a hallucination. Every sight, smell, and feeling was indicating that she might _possibly, not really, actually_ be having a stroke.\n\nJiaojiao grit her teeth and began her second kowtow. Ignoring the buzzing in her head. A new box of text popped up next to the first, bobbing insistently. She gave it a cursory glance then covertly rolled her eyes.\n\n_Bai Jing laughed as the servant wailed in pain..._\n\n_Bai Jing broke Bai Xingwu's hand with a snap of her fist..._\n\n_\"How dare you call this great aunt a slut? Are you speaking of yourself?\"_\n\nOn her fifth kowtow, sweat began to head on her brow. Jiaojiao didn't enjoy pain and in fact usually went out of her way to avoid it-- like a normal person. This experience was swiftly becoming the most painful one she'd ever had the misfortune of encountering.\n\nJiaojiao touched her head to the dusty floor for the six time, the ground now damp with her sweat.\n\n\"Cry for me,\" Bai Xingwu suggested cooly. \"Ask for my forgiveness.\"\n\nWith a sniff, Jiaojiao began to wail and covered her face with her hands, pressing down on her eyelids until her tear glands welled up with physiological tears. Blinking rapidly, she choked on her sobs as she coyly looked down.\n\n\"Hah! You're so ugly,\" the girl said, \"kowtow to me nine times and I'll let you go for today!\"\n\nThe ground beneath her face was now dotted with tears as well as saliva and sweat. Jiaojiao wailed theatrically.\n\n\"Look how ugly she is.\"\n\n\"Hideous.\"\n\n\"So disgusting.\"\n\nJiaojiao sobbed noisily, slurping a disgusting mixture of snot and tears with every inhale and exhale. The buzzing had now grown to deafening levels and Jiaojiao could hardly hear the servants deprecating commentary. Jiaojiao's entire focus had narrowed to the pain in her leg, and she had begun shaking from maintaining her posture. Only a certain premonition was preventing her from breaking this farce of a scene.\n\nThankfully, Bai Xingwu soon grew bored of the spectacle and takes before swinging her head, hairpins flashing with lustrous light.\n\n\"Let this be a lesson to you, slut! Don't you dare covet the crown prince! He is the heavens and you are less than dirt,\" the girl spat, then left with a swish of her sleeves, leaving behind only the scent of jasmine. Her two servants shot Jiaojiao one last ridiculing glance, then scurried after their mistress, kicking the ruins of the door aside on their way out.\n\nJiaojiao's cries cut off with a abruptness that struck of artificiality. She wiped her face with a tattered sleeve and regarded her departing audience with a lackluster expression.\n\nWhen the trio has disappeared from view, so too did the buzzing cease.\n\nThe air grew heavy and solemn as Jiaojiao scanned her surroundings, hobbling back to the _kang_, now sporting two mango sized holes.\n\n\"All right, there's no one here,\" Jiaojiao said to the air. \"Come out.\"","lastmodified":"2022-04-02T05:47:41.357051861Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/NaNoWriMo-April-2022":{"title":"üå± NaNoWriMo-April 2022","content":"---\n\nI've had this idea for a book series bouncing around for quite some time and [NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org/what-is-camp-nanowrimo) was just the excuse that I needed to jumpstart the whole endeavor.
