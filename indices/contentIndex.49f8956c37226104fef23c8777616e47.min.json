From the scuffed corners of the _hongmu_ armoire, to the cracked surface of the low tea table with mother of pearl inlay, every detail screamed of bygone grandeur. The mustiness in the air hinted at age and neglect.\n\nJIaojiao didn't react for a good ten seconds, staring here and there at the ratty paper windows, thrice mended and patched with ragged bits of cloth, at the exposed brown bricks beyond the cracked lime plaster, at the moth eaten covers over her too-small lap. She held up her bony hands, chapped, with yellowed uneven nails.\n\n\"Oh no,\" Jiaojiao spoke aloud. \"I'm having a stroke.\"\n\nBecause, that could be the only explanation for this... this farce of a hallucination, right? She had only just been arguing with... who was it? Right, Superb_Ninja2394, defending her controversial decision to pair Galaxy Sunrise nail polish with hot pink stripes and gold decals. Why else would she be seeing this scene out of a half-baked period drama. It was a stroke.\n\nA stroke. It had to be.\n\nBecause... what would be the alternative?\n\nWith mounting horror, Jiaojiao used her not-her-hands to touch her not-her-face. It was small, thin, and _unmoisturized_. _Who was this person?_\n\nShe didn't get to dwell on it further before the door to the bedroom burst open with a crack of distressed wood.\n\n\"Bai Xingyue, you slut!\" cried a sweet young voice.\n\nFramed in the doorway, with her leg still raised in a high-kick, was a young girl in a pink _hanfu_, perhaps twelve to fifteen years old. Pearled hairpins in the shapes of flowers and birds swayed with her movements. Her tender face was scrunched in a scowl that was more cute in the way of angry kittens and growling puppies, than intimidating.\n\nBai Xingyue? Is she talking about _not-me_?\n\nThe girl didn't waste a second rushing into the room, hand raised in a maneuver Jiaojiao recognized well as the classic posture for a slap, so well exemplified in Chinese harem dramas. She shifted out of the way, though her body responded much more sluggishly than she was used to.\n\nThe angry girl's pink embroidered sleeves billowed as her fist landed on the traditional _kang_ bed. Rather than bouncing off the woven bottom as Jiaojiao expected, that tiny palm blasted through in an explosion of bamboo shards.\n\n\"You dare dodge?!\" The girl screeched, then pouted at the _audacity_.\n\nJiaojiao was too baffled to speak. What then? So should she stay still and get her head smashed in? The hell was with this strength? Was this ninety pound loli She-ra incarnate?\n\n\"I-- I'm sorry?\" Jiaojiao finally rasped out, noting that the voice was not her voice, but what else was new? The moment the words were out of her-- _not-her mouth_, there was a brief buzz in Jiaojiao's mind. Jiaojiao frowned, raising a hand to her head. More signs she was having a stroke, surely.\n\n\"You think apologizing is enough?\" the girl sneered, hand raised for another slap. \"You slut. Why didn't you just drown in that pond?¬†You think such lowly tactics would attract the crown prince? Naive!\"\n\n*What was this about a crown prince? So this is a historical drama? What dynasty? Is this a drama with wuxia elements?* Jiaojiao thought wildly to herself. How else to explain this girls strength? Her mind swiftly ran the gamut of routine hypotheticals. *Is this a movie set? Am I getting punked? Where are the cameras? Where is the crew? Is this a dream? Why am I even thinking about this? I could be dying right as we speak, brain cells withering from lack of oxygen! Are the paramedics even on the way?* Knowing her usual audience they wouldn't care to call for help even if it became obvious rigor was setting in.\n\n_Doomed. I'm doomed._\n\nThe pink loli didn't take kindly to being ignored. Jiaojiao felt a distinct danger to her hallucinatory life as that white hand descended for another slap. She hastily rolled away though she felt serious doubts about her current situation. Surely none of this mattered even if her head did became roadkill? That is-- If she truly was having a stroke. The bed groaned as another hole appeared by the first.\n\n\"The crown prince wouldn't even deign to let you lick his shoes! You're a toad lusting for swan meat!\" The girl sneered. \"You should just kill yourself and save me the trouble of dirtying my hands!\"\n\n\"The crown prince?\" Jiaojiao parroted, curled up in the corner of the bed, bracketed by wall and headboard and and covered in bamboo slivers.\n\n\"You still have the face to speak of the crown prince!?\"\n\nThird slap incoming, Jiaojiao had run out of rolling space. She hastily raised both hands in a gesture of surrender. \"Wait!\"\n\nThe girl paused and regarded Jiaojiao in disgust. Behind her, two servants in plain blue robes had entered at some point and were staring at Jiaojiao in shaudenfraude.\n\n\"I have no interest in the crown prince,\" Jiaojiao said. It was the truth, who was this crown prince even?\n\n\"Hah! As if I would believe your lies!\"\n\n\"Hold on!\" Jiaojiao called, interrupting that hand descending like a guillotine. \"I-- I've lost my memories!\"\n\n\"Hah?\" The girl glared, but the hand remained suspended.\n\n\"I... don't even know who you are?\" Jiaojiao supplied.\n\nThe girl scrutinized Jiaojiao from head to toe, as if there would be physical signs to elude to the veracity of that statement. She leaned forward, staring into Jiaojiao's face.\n\n\"Don't believe her, young miss,\" one of the servants interrupted.\n\n\"She's just lying to escape punishment,\" the other servant agreed.\n\nJiaojiao met the girl's gaze straight on. \"I really truly have lost my memories. I don't even know my own name.\"\n\n\"What a liar,\" the first servant laughed. \"Just slap her to death.\"\n\n\"Slap her to death!\"\n\n_What is wrong with these people?_\n\n\"Hmph,\" the girl finally smiled. \"So what if you don't remember? Now hold still so I can rid the world of an eyesore.\"\n\n\"You're seriously trying to kill her-- me?\" Jiaojiao asked with doubt.\n\n\"You finally understand,\" the girl smiled. Objectively, it was a nice smile on a pretty face, but it made the hairs stand up on the back of Jiaojiao's neck.\n\n\"Can we talk about this?\" Jiaojiao scrunched herself as far as she could go into the corner.\n\n\"What is there to talk about? You should have died back there in that pond. I'm just finishing the job.\"\n\nJiaojiao could only watch as that hand resumed its merciless descent, a harsh buzz began in her mind as the palm neared her unprotected face. The buzz reached an annoying crescendo then cut off with a wrathful pop.\n\nA bright box bloomed into view, floating in Jiaojiao's vision like a phantom.\n\nSimultaneously, the girl's descending slap suddenly veered off to the right and hit the wall with a crackle of broken plaster.\n\nThough her face had narrowly escaped getting pancaked by mere millimeters, Jiaojiao could only stare at the floating box in befuddlement. It was a translucent screen with a block of white text scrolling past and looked like something out of a VR simulation.\n\nThe girl hissed and shook out her blushing palm, smarting from the impact to the brick wall. \"You bitch, how dare you dodge!?\"\n\nThe servants darted forward, cooing in distress over their mistress's hand.\n\n\"You wretch! How could you hurt the miss's hand like this!\"\n\nJiaojiao was too distracted to answer, eyes riveted on the contents of that floating box that no one else seemed to see.\n\n*Bai Jing woke in a dirty old bedroom...**\n\n_Bai Jing smiled enchantingly as she caught Bai Xingwu's hand in an iron fist..._\n\n_Bai Jing kicked the girl away with her slim leg..._\n\n_Bai Jing slapped the impudent servant..._\n\n_Bai Jing..._\n\n\"Who the fuck is Bai Jing?\" Jiaojiao said.\n\nThe girl and the two servants stared agog at her outburst.\n\n\"Is there a Bai Jing in the family?\"\n\n\"I don't think so.\"\n\n\"What is she staring at?\"\n\n\"Maybe she's finally gone crazy.\"\n\n\"Heh! If I were her, I would've have gone crazy when I first heard I was a martial cripple.\"\n\n\"I would have just hung myself and ended it all.\"\n\n\"How could the crown prince have such a hideous toad for a fianc√©?\"\n\nThe servants tittered.\n\n\"Silence!\" The girl snapped, still rubbing her sore hand. \"Don't speak of the crown prince with your lowly mouths!\"\n\nThe servants bowed their heads. Though chastised, the corners of their lips turned up as they snuck glances at Jiaojiao and the girl in pink, no doubt anticipating the ensuing carnage.\n\nWhat bunch of manipulative she-devils.\n\nJiaojiao finally turned her gaze back to the bristling girl in pink, having finished digesting the contents of the floating box-- though not all of it made sense, she was beginning to get a hint of what was going on.\n\n\"Is your name Bai Xingwu?\"\n\nThe girl curled her lip up in ridicule. \"I thought you lost your memories?\"\n\n\"So it is,\" Jiaojiao pointed to the ghostly text box. \"None of you see that?\"\n\n\"See what? Don't think pretending to be crazy will get you out of anything!\"\n\n\"What do you want me to do?\" Jiaojiao asked, exasperated. \"Should I just lie down and let you kill me?\"\n\n\"It would be your honor to be killed by me!\"\n\nJiaojiao refrained from rolling her eyes. \"What can I do so that you won't kill me?\"\n\nBai Xingwu smiled, eyes crinkling in mirthful crescents. \"Kowtow. Kowtow until I tell you to stop.\"\n\n*And what if you never tell me to stop?* Jiaojiao rebutted internally. \"Fine,\" she said instead with a diplomatic smile and crawled off of the _kang_, avoiding the wreckage of the girl's punches. She paused as her right leg gave a twinge in pain.\n\n\"What are you waiting for?\" Bai Xingwu prodded, her smile mean and knowing.\n\nJiaojiao shuffled awkwardly to the dusty floor, then knelt, right knee now screaming in protest. There was definitely something up with that leg but she didn't currently have the time to address it. She took a distracted moment to admire Bai Xingwu's pearl-studded shoes, then lowered her head in the first kowtow, grimacing as the dirty floor neared her face. After a minute pause, her forehead touched the ground with an audible tap.\n\nThe harsh buzzing began anew. The girl gave her a pointed glare when Jiaojiao paused in thought.\n\n_It's all a stroke anyway! Why am I worrying?_\n\nOnly Jiaojiao knew herself fairly well, and she wasn't imaginative enough to dream this shit up by far.\n\nShe was feeling pain in a hallucination-- maybe not a hallucination. Every sight, smell, and feeling was indicating that she might _possibly, not really, actually_ be having a stroke.\n\nJiaojiao grit her teeth and began her second kowtow. Ignoring the buzzing in her head. A new box of text popped up next to the first, bobbing insistently. She gave it a cursory glance, then covertly rolled her eyes.\n\n_Bai Jing laughed as the servant wailed in pain..._\n\n_Bai Jing broke Bai Xingwu's hand with a snap of her wrist..._\n\n_\"How dare you call this great aunt a slut? Are you speaking of yourself?\"_\n\nOn her fifth kowtow, sweat began to head on her brow. Jiaojiao didn't enjoy pain and in fact usually went out of her way to avoid it-- like a normal person. This experience was swiftly becoming the most painful one she'd ever had the misfortune of encountering.\n\nJiaojiao touched her head to the dusty floor for the six time, the ground now damp with her sweat.\n\n\"Cry for me,\" Bai Xingwu suggested cooly. \"Ask for my forgiveness.\"\n\nWith a sniff, Jiaojiao began to wail and covered her face with her dusty hands, pressing down on her eyelids until her tear glands welled up with physiological tears. Blinking rapidly, she choked on her sobs as she coyly looked down.\n\n\"Hah! You're so ugly,\" the girl said, \"kowtow to me nine times and I'll let you go for today!\"\n\nThe ground beneath her face was now dotted with tears as well as saliva and sweat. Jiaojiao wailed theatrically, face coated in dust and grime.\n\n\"Look how ugly she is.\"\n\n\"Hideous.\"\n\n\"So disgusting.\"\n\nJiaojiao sobbed noisily, slurping a disgusting mixture of snot and tears with every inhale and exhale. The buzzing had now grown to deafening levels and Jiaojiao could hardly hear the servants deprecating commentary. Jiaojiao's entire focus had narrowed to the pain in her leg, and she had begun shaking from maintaining her posture. Only a certain premonition was preventing her from breaking this farce of a scene.\n\nThankfully, Bai Xingwu soon grew bored of the spectacle and takes before swinging her head, hairpins flashing with lustrous light.\n\n\"Let this be a lesson to you, slut! Don't you dare covet the crown prince! He is the heavens and you are less than dirt,\" the girl spat, then left with a swish of her sleeves, leaving behind only the scent of jasmine. Her two servants shot Jiaojiao one last ridiculing glance, then scurried after their mistress, kicking the ruins of the door aside on their way out.\n\nJiaojiao's cries cut off with an abruptness that struck of artificiality. She wiped her face with a tattered sleeve and regarded her departing audience with a lackluster expression.\n\nWhen the trio disappeared from view, so too did the buzzing cease.\n\nThe air grew heavy and solemn as Jiaojiao scanned her surroundings, hobbling back to the _kang_, now sporting two mango sized holes.\n\n\"All right, there's no one here,\" Jiaojiao said to the air. \"Come out.\"","lastmodified":"2022-04-04T02:20:41.776624095Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/Chapter02-The-Missing-Heroine":{"title":"Chapter 02-The Missing Heroine","content":"There was a heavy silence the moment Jiaojiao spoke to the empty room. Oppressive and somehow, sullen.\n\n*How did you know?* A voice asked sourly in her head. It was an ambiguous voice with a distinct lack of defining characteristics, neither male nor female and neither young or old.\n\n\"Did you think you were being subtle with the buzzing and humming?\" Jiaojiao scoffed, scanning the room for the disembodied voice. \"It was like having a silenced phone go off directly by my ear. Where are you anyway?\"\n\nA dim cloud of light, about the size of two fists popped into existence directly in front of Jiaojiao. She eyed it curiously. This was the the source of infernal buzzing?\n\n\"Who are you? What the hell is going on?\"\n\n*Who I am is none of your concern.*\n\n\"I'd say that's a sizzling hot take given that you're a hundred percent responsible for--\" she gestured at her current body.\n\nThe ball of light gave a disdainful buzz. *You're not required to know.*\n\n*Wow.* \"You got a name?\"\n\nThere came a prickling feeling from the cloud of light that Jiaojiao translated as irritation. *That's not important. What is important is that you were a disgrace just now. Why did you kowtow?*\n\n\"And what was the alternative? Let her squash me like a rice cake?\"\n\n*You could have fought back,* the ball of light grumbled. *You should-- what are you doing?!*\n\nJiaojiao tsked as her hand closed around nothing, the ball of light darting away from her grasping fingers. \n\n*How ill-mannered!* The ball scolded. *Keep your hands to yourself!*\n\n\"I'd say you've gone way beyond the boundaries of rudeness when you whisked my-- what? Soul? Into this place.\"\n\n*Can you be compared to me, puny mortal?*\n\n\"Puny mortal? Oh, it's like that is it?\" Jiaojiao smiled thinly. \"What does that make you, a god?\"\n\n*I may as well be a god!*\n\n\"Well, forgive me my impudence, oh *god*.\"\n\nA grudging hum. *You are forgiven, mortal. I myself made an error in judgement. I should not have put much expectation in your decorum in the first place given your... occupation.*\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n*You are after all--* a delicate pause *--an entertainer.*\n\n\"Entertain-- what?\"\n\n*And entertainers are not known for their refined behavior.*\n\nJiaojiao eyed the ball of light in thought. It seemed, the thing, god or whatever, had a superficial understanding of her, and an even worse understanding of the world she came from. And his sensibilities were downright ancient.\n\n\"What makes you think I'm an entertainer?\" she asked.\n\n*What else would you call what you do? You display yourself for the amusement of others. Is this not the definition of an entertainer? A lowly occupation with no meaningful worth to society?*\n\n\"Christ, who are you, my mother?\"\n\n*But we seem to have ventured onto a tangental thread of conversation. We were discussing--what are you doing now?!*\n\nJiaojiao ignored the ball and lifted the hem of her frayed robes and rolled up her pants to look at that damned right leg that had been troubling her. A knotted expanse of scar tissue and a crooked calf met her horrified gaze. She silently dropped the hem of her robe. *Not my body, not my problem.*\n\n*See this is exactly what I meant! No lady-like bearing at all! Baring your flesh for all the world to see!*\n\n\"The world isn't in here. Just you,\" Jiaojiao said. \"And besides, shouldn't it be you who is in the wrong for being in a young girl's boudoir?\"\n\n*As I was saying,* the ball's light pulsed with rage, *you have a lot to answer for, you disgraceful harlot.*\n\n\"No, don't hold back on my account. Tell me what you really think.\"\n\n*You bowed and scraped like a beggar. Have you seen yourself?*\n\n\"No actually,\" Jiaojiao answered. \"I can say with all honesty I have never seen myself.\"\n\n*Well, you are an absolute shame to behold! I am embarrassed on your behalf! Did you really have to kowtow?* the ball of light continued. *If you could have just--*\n\n\"Fought back?\" she pointed at her leg. \"You've seen the leg. This body is basically crippled.\"\n\n*Bai Jing did it, and she had the same leg. She fought Bai Xingwu and won. That's how it's supposed to go. Bai Xingwu and her two servants retreat in terror after losing to Bai Jing in a three on one fight.* The ball of light paused, and a heavy sense of oppression emanated from it. *At least, that's how it's supposed to go.*\n\nJiaojiao smiled a smile that wasn't a smile. \"Say, are you confused about something? What do those three have to do with me? Why should any of this have anything to do with me? You and I both know that I'm not this Bai Jing person.\"\n\nA heavy pause. The light flickered like a staticky TV.\n\n*Interesting.* The it finally said. *Most people would hesitate before admitting they weren't the person meant to be here. After all, you just died and it can be surmised that I'm the sole reason you still live and breathe...**\n\n\"Yes, yes, yes, you are very mighty, very powerful, I am very impress,\" Jiaojiao waved a hand. \"That doesn't change the fact that I am not Bai Jing and you can't expect me to behave like her.\"\n\n*You don't have a choice. You have already died. The person you were no longer exists. If you cannot be Bai Jing then there is no use for you at all.*\n\nJiaojiao wrinkled her nose then took a sniff of her shoulder, having been nagged by the faint smell of mildew ever since waking. She got a whiff of stagnant water and algae. A tell-tale patch of green on her sleeve drew her attention. Well, that angry little girl had said something about a near drowning. A completed drowning? After all, *she* was here.\n\n*It should be obvious that I hold your very life and death in my hands...*\n\nJiaojiao sidestepped the ball and hobbled over to the battered armoire taking a hold of the ornated bronze handles, green with oxidation. When a firm tug left the doors unbudging, she leveraged all eighty-five pounds of her new body to wrench it open. Her arms ached with the strain and the nerves in her bum leg screamed in protest. The doors stuck on each other, swollen with age and moisture. A glance overhead revealed a patch of missing roof tiles, repaired haphazardly with a few handfuls of thatch and straw twine.\n\nInside the armoire was a collection of worn and aged clothing, moth-eaten silk and frayed cotton in various washed out colors. Jiaojiao paused. Did she really have to don these... these *rags*?\n\n*If you want to continue living, you will do well to follow my instructions... are you listening to me?*\n\n\"Yes, I am very invested in this conversation. Do continue.\"\n\n*You are dead.*\n\n\"Uh huh.\"\n\n*... shouldn't you be more upset?*\n\n \"What?\" Jiaojiao rifled through the meager selection of *hanfu*. \"Should I be weeping and wailing? Groveling at your feet for absolution?\"\n\n*It would be the expected reaction.*\n\n\"I'm already dead, what's to be done?'\" Jiaojiao said. \"I won't waste my time begging you for something you won't change. After all, if you were truly kind, you would have revived me in my own body instead of casting me as this Bai Jing person.\"\n\nA hum of grudging agreement came from the ball. *I brought you here for a purpose.*\n\nJIaojiao chose one of the least ratty robes and pulled it from the armoire. \"Avert your virgin eyes, o' god, for this filthy mortal entertainer is about to disrobe.\"\n\nThe ball gave a disgusted snarl and zipped to hide behind the armoire door. *Have you heard a single word I've said? Must you do that now?*\n\n\"Dead mortal, alive on your grace, here for a mission. I'm all ears. And yes, I'm reeking of pond scum, and I simply cannot stand it a second longer.\"\n\n*...as I was saying, your only purpose here is to take the place of Bai Jing.*\n\n\"What happened to her anyway?\" Jiaojiao asked as she shucked the damp robe from her body. It was of noticeably finer make and she would have preferred wearing it to the beggars garment she was shortly about to don were it not foul with pond water.\n\nThe ball of light paused, as if loathe to disclose an iota more information than absolutely necessary. *She failed the appear at the correct time. We were forced to take drastic measures to ensure the continuity of this fateline.*\n\nJiaojiao's eyes flashed as she bowed her head to tie the belt on her clean robe. *Fate-line? Does that have something to do with that box of text I just saw?* \"So I have her to thank for this second life?\"\n\n*You have __me__ to thank for this second life.*\n\n\"Sure boss, whatever you say.\"\n\n*I'm glad you understand your position. Just do as you're told and all will be well.*\n\n\"What happens if I don't do as I'm told?\"\n\nThe ball of light floated in front of Jiaojiao. A palpable oppression prickled at her skin as the light burst in intensity, bright stripes strobed across its surface. *Then I'll get rid of you and find a more obedient replacement.* \n\nJiaojiao shivered, then smiled thinly. \"Got it.\"\n\nThe ball seemed satisfied with her response, withdrawing out of arms reach and the light dimmed to less blinding levels.\n\n\"So what do I have to do?\"\n\nThe light began to strobe again. *Hold still, this will only hurt a bit.*\n\nThe world exploded into light.\n\nJiaojiao eyes stung as the light hit her eyes, she lifted an arm to shield herself, but it didn't seem to make a difference. The it was like the light was piercing straight past her flesh and directly impacting her brain tissue. The beginnings of a migraine began to make itself known as dense blocks of text scrolled past her vision at an accelerated pace. Even as Jiaojiao thought that this was far too fast for anyone to read, the information seared itself into her mind as though it was being directly funneled into her synapses.\n\n*Bai Jing stood at the cliffside with her lover Fei Chen. The distant sunset gave a romantic backdrop to their rendevous.*\n\n*\"Fel Chen, it has been almost ten years since we made that promise.\"\n\n*\"I remember...\"*\n\n*\"We can leave everything behind now...\"*\n\n*Fei Chen embraced Bai Jing, smiling down at his beautiful fiance. Bai Jing smiled and turned her face upwards to receive his fiery kiss...*\n\n*Bai Jing gasped, the pulled back at a sudden sharp pain on her chest. Right over her heart pierced a dagger. A brilliant blood-red flower bloomed...*\n\n*\"Why?\" she asked the sinisterly smiling Fei Chen.*\n\n\"I've never loved you, Bai Jing? Who would love a coarse mercenary like you? My true love is your half-sister! I was only after the inheritance your mother left you!\" \n\n*Fei Chen snatched the embroidered pouch from Bai Jing's chilled fingers.*\n\n*\"Fei Chen, you better pray I don't live, or I'll make you sorry...\"*\n\n*Bai Jing plunged from the cliff...*\n\nJiaojiao could only stand, transfixed as more text scrolled past her vision. She screwed her eyes shut, but nothing could stop the information pouring into her mind. Dear lord this is torture.\n\n*Bai Jing awoke in an ancient bedroom...*\n\n*Bai Jing spoke to the reflection in the bronze mirror. \"Fate has given me a second chance, I won't let your sacrifice go to waste. I will avenge all your grievamces and punish all those who drove you to your death!\"\"*\n\n*Bai Jing kicked Bai Xingwu across the room...*\n\n*Bai Jing smiled...*\n\n*Bai Jing laughed...*\n\n*Bai Jing sneered...*\n\nJiaojiao felt like she was going crazy. On and on it went until finally the text slowed to a crawl before disappearing with a faint pop. She opened her eyes and gave the ball of light a dirty look.\n\n*Well?* The ball of light said impatiently, *Did you get all of it?*\n\nJiaojiao gave a mirthless chuckle. \"Oh I got it. There's just one little problem.\"\n\n*What is it?*\n\n\"Are you kidding? You made it sound like some grand mission but I can't do this,\" JIaojiao shook her head. \"Nope. I can't help you.\" \n\n*I don't follow.*\n\n\"You don't need a heroine! You need an editor!

I'm a pretty heavy reader of the transmigration and isekai genres, and while there are things I enjoy about them, there are also things that I find quite annoying about them. \n\nI will not say too much about them here, but only mention my top three pet peeves; sexism, abundance of filler, and a seemingly endless parade of doctor-assassin heroines. I don't know what it is about this trope that deserves replicating with reckless abandon but...\n\n- [Genius Doctor: Black Belly Miss](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/genius-doctor-black-belly-miss/)\n- [Poisoning the World: The Secret Service Mysterious Doctor is a Young Beastly Wife](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/poisoning-the-world-the-secret-service-mysterious-doctor-is-a-young-beastly-wife/)\n- [Poison Genius Consort](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/poison-genius-consort/)\n- [Princess Medical Doctor](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/princess-medical-doctor/)\n- [Divine Doctor: Daughter of the First Wife](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/divine-doctor-daughter-of-the-first-wife/)\n- [The Demonic King Chases His Wife: The Rebellious Good-for-Nothing Miss](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/the-demonic-king-chases-his-wife-the-rebellious-good-for-nothing-miss/)\n- [Bewitching Prince Spoils His Wife: Genius Doctor Unscrupulous Consort](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/bewitching-prince-spoils-his-wife-genius-doctor-unscrupulous-consort/)\n\nIt just never ends. Before you ask, no, I have not read every book in that list, are you kidding? Some of these monsters are 10,000+ chapters ([not a typo](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/bewitching-prince-spoils-his-wife-genius-doctor-unscrupulous-consort/))--  and I would happily read those 10,000 chapters if there wasn't such a lack of substance. Aaah the webnovel industry in China in a nutshell. Much length, no girth. ü§≠\n\nSo many times I've read a story that was kind of enjoyable, and then something happens where I go, wow, why did they have to write it like _that?_ I would have done it like...\n\nSo I decided to just try my hand and writing my own. \n\nThis world and its people are inspired by the tropes commonly seen in [C-Novels and Japanese light novels](https://www.novelupdates.com). This as of unnamed world is my spin on the doctor-assassin in a [xianxia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xianxia_(genre)) setting... that is, if the heroine somehow [failed to show up](NaNoWriMo/TianDiRen-Blurb). \n\nThis work will be part parody, part criticism, and partly my own unique take on a xianxia world. So yeah, the magic system and the characters in this story aren't going to be the most original thing ever. In fact, much of what I'm writing is stuff that is tired as hell in the transmigration genre, but what I hope to bring to the table is my own unique spin-- and I hope to have fun while doing it!\n\nEveryone, have a good month! ‚ù§Ô∏è","lastmodified":"2022-04-04T02:20:41.776624095Z","tags":null},"/NaNoWriMo/Webnovel-Recommendations":{"title":"C-Novel, LightNovel, and K-Novel Recommendations","content":"Though trying to find a good book in the sea of [Novel Updates](https://www.novelupdates.com/) is often like wading through a sea of trash, there are many shining gems in the genre if one would care to look.\n\nHere are my personal recommendations if you're curious. Depending on their current licensing status, the chapters available online might be paywalled.\n\n## Chinese\n- [I Shall Seal the Heavens](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/) Old favorite, probably the one that got me hooked on C-Novels.\n- [The Legendary Mechanic](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/the-legendary-mechanic/) Also has a pretty decent manhua adaptation that just began.\n- [Crossing to the Future, it's Not Easy to Be a Man](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/crossing-to-the-future-its-not-easy-to-be-a-man/) Incomplete, and indefinitely on hiatus.
